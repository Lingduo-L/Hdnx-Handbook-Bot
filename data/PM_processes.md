## PM

#### •           3-person meeting (Sales + PM + CTO/Delivery Lead)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

* ClickUp task: “Project Received” → assigned to PM

📁 Tracked in: Handoff_Log.csv + PM signature required  

#### 🎯 Process 4 – Assign a Clear Owner to Every Module or Function  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Goal:**
Avoid ambiguity and delays by assigning a single operational Owner to each project area—no shared responsibility, no confusion.  

Actors Involved:  

* Owner: Can be a Developer, UX, PM, or Salesperson, depending on the topic
* Project Manager: Ensures that every task/module has an Owner assigned and tracked
* Team Leads: Support the Owner but do not replace them

**Tools:**

* ClickUp → Custom field called Owner for every task, feature, or deliverable
* Notion → Mirrors ownership in each module section (auto-synced or manual link)
* (Optional): Slackbot / Tines can alert when tasks lack an Owner or if inactivity is detected

🔧 How It Works:  

1. At Kickoff or Sprint Planning:

Every task, module (e.g., frontend UI, backend API, robotic unit, image recognition), or external delivery must have a named Owner.  

2. In ClickUp:

Use the Owner custom field for each card/task → shows up in task views, dashboards, and reports.  

3. In Notion:

Within each section of a project (e.g., “UX”, “Backend”, “Delivery to Client”), list the Owner name visibly. Add a profile link for reference.  

4. Responsibilities of the Owner:
    - ✅ Track and push forward the execution (progress, blockers, timelines)
    - ✅ Communicate status updates in stand-ups, handovers, and weekly PM syncs
    - ✅ Update relevant documentation (Notion, Confluence, NAS folders)
    - ✅ Coordinate with others, but they remain the reference person at all times
5. If the Owner Changes:

It must be updated both in ClickUp and Notion, with handover notes written or recorded (e.g., Loom).  

Frequency:  

* Must be set for every item before work starts
* Reviewed weekly by PMs or during sprint retros

**Benefits:**

* No more diluted responsibility
* Clear point of contact for any topic
* Enables async clarity, especially cross-timezone
* Supports traceability during audits, handovers, or board reviews

#### ⏰ Process 5 – Daily Fixed Time Slots for Cross-Timezone Sync  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, MeetGeek, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Goal:**
Establish a consistent daily window for real-time communication across timezones, ensuring alignment, velocity, and full team accountability.  

Actors Involved:  
All departments: Dev, PM, UX/UI, Sales, Marketing, Legal, Admin, Support, Field Ops  

**Tools:**

* Google Calendar – recurring blocks, visible to all
* Google Meet / Zoom – pre-attached to each slot
* (Optional): MeetGeek for automatic call summaries

🔧 How It Works:  

1. Fixed Overlap Window:

Every weekday (Monday to Friday), from:  
17:00–19:00 CET / 8:00–10:00 PT  

2. Daily Block Structure:

This window is reserved exclusively for:  

    - Quick alignments between Italy ↔ US
    - Issue resolution and unblockings
    - Strategic updates from CEO/PMs
    - Team-specific check-ins or releases
3. Team Scheduling:

Each department (Dev, UX, PM, etc.) has at least one mandatory call per week within this window, pre-scheduled in the shared calendar.  

Additional calls (if needed) can happen within the same window, but require at least 24 hours notice to allow for teams to prepare, and allow for work-from-home if necessary.  

4. Participation is Mandatory:
    - “Being present” is not enough
    - Everyone must actively contribute, with updates, questions, or decisions
    - Camera-on is strongly encouraged (unless specified otherwise)
5. An agenda must be shared before each meeting, and contributed to by all attendees:

All other communication (outside this slot) remains asynchronous: Notion, ClickUp, Slack.  

6. Async Before/After:

All other communication (outside this slot) remains asynchronous: Notion, ClickUp, Slack.  

Frequency:  
🗓 Daily (Monday–Friday)  

📍 Department-specific calls: at least 1× per week  
📌 Managed via shared Google Calendar + automated reminders  

**Benefits:**

* Guarantees rhythm and face-to-face alignment
* Reduces timezone friction
* Builds accountability and team culture
* Prevents execution delays and misunderstandings

#### 🧘 Process 16 – Monthly Strategic Reset Day  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** 33  

**Context & Problem:**
High-speed execution leads to technical debt, messy docs, and mental fatigue. Teams rarely get time to clean, rethink, or organize.  

**Goal:**
Once a month, give everyone protected time to step back, reorganize, and clear operational clutter.  

**How It Works:**

* Block ½ day per month in the shared calendar
* No meetings, no deadlines, no releases
* Activities include:
    - Cleaning old tasks
    - Updating docs
    - Organizing Figma files
    - Archiving things no longer relevant

**Tools:**
ClickUp, Figma, Notion → calendar block  

**Benefits:**

* Improves long-term quality
* Reduces confusion and clutter
* Boosts morale and focus

#### 🔄 Process 22 – Quarterly Mini-OKRs for Every Team  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Teams often focus on their own “busywork,” without alignment on what truly matters for the company right now.  

**Goal:**
Every team defines 3 clear operational priorities (Mini-OKRs) per quarter, aligned with company goals—without making it bureaucratic.  

**How It Works:**

1. Each team (Dev, UX, Marketing, Sales, PM):
    - Defines 3 Mini-Objectives with 1–2 Key Results each
    - These should be:
    - Specific, visible
    - Achievable within the quarter
    - Tied to product, growth, or quality goals
2. No bonus or financial pressure:
    - These OKRs are for clarity, not control
    - Used during sprint planning and retrospectives for focus and reporting
3. Review:
    - Reviewed by the CEO or a PM delegate
    - Updated in Notion or Asana OKR tracker
    - Shared with the full company for transparency

**Tools:**
Notion / Asana  

**Benefits:**

* Creates alignment across departments
* Helps cut noise and focus on real impact
* Promotes team visibility without micromanagement

#### 🎓 Process 24 – Weekly Internal Teaching Slot (Rotating Knowledge Sharing)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Other, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Team members often know what tools we use (Notion, Git, Figma...), but not how to master them.  
Expertise stays trapped in silos.  

**Goal:**
Create a low-pressure, recurring internal learning moment, where team members teach each other practical things that elevate everyone.  

**How It Works:**

1. Once a month, a different team member hosts a 1-hour session
    - Can be live or recorded via Loom
    - Format is open: demo, explanation, workflow walk-through
2. Topics can include:
    - How to prepare a dev PR properly
    - Design tokens and Figma libraries
    - How to structure ClickUp tasks
    - Building a dashboard in Notion
    - How to plan GTM strategies or read analytics
3. Participation:
    - Everyone is encouraged to attend, ask questions
    - Recordings are stored in a Notion "Knowledge Library"
4. PM or Ops person curates calendar + reminders

**Tools:**
Google Calendar → Loom / Zoom → Notion (for archive)  

**Benefits:**

* Spreads internal knowledge
* Increases tool mastery
* Builds culture of excellence and teaching
* Promotes cross-role empathy

#### 📉 Process 25 – FAILLOG: Documenting Mistakes to Avoid Repetition  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** 12  

**Context & Problem:**
When bugs, design errors, or wrong decisions occur, they’re often discussed briefly and forgotten.  
The result? Teams repeat the same mistakes—losing time and credibility.  

**Goal:**
Create a lightweight, team-editable log to document what didn’t work, what was learned, and how to avoid it next time.  

**How It Works:**

* For every project, create a file called faillog.md (or a Notion page titled “Fails & Fixes”)
* Anyone on the team can add entries after releases, sprints, or post-mortems
* Each entry includes:
    - ❌ What didn’t work
    - 💡 What we learned
    - 🛠 How to prevent this in the future
* The tone is constructive, not accusatory.
* The log is accessible to everyone, including new joiners.

**Tools:**
GitHub Wiki or Notion  
(Optional: link from milestone task in ClickUp)  

**Benefits:**

* Promotes continuous learning
* Prevents knowledge loss
* Builds operational maturity over time

#### ⚙️ Process 28 – “What’s Blocking Us?” → Transparent Escalation System  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Communication, Deployment & Delivery  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Many blockers aren’t reported until it's too late to act without delay or rework.  

**Goal:**
Build a lightweight, transparent system to flag blockers early—without blame, and without requiring a meeting.  

**How It Works:**

* Every ClickUp task includes a required field: Blocked: Yes / No
* If marked Yes, Tines triggers an automatic alert with:
    - 🔗 Task title and link
    - 👤 Person responsible
    - ✏️ 2-line description of the blocker
* Alerts go to:
    - Project Manager
    - Team lead or tech owner
    - Optional: Slack channel like #blocked or #ops
* Once a week, a digest of active blockers is sent out and reviewed.

**Tools:**
ClickUp → Tines → Slack Digest (optional)  

**Benefits:**

* Makes obstacles visible early
* Clarifies responsibility
* Creates shared ownership for solving problems

#### 🪪 Process 30 – “Topic Owners” (Not Just Project Owners)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Some critical areas (e.g., accessibility, frontend performance, documentation quality) don’t fall under any specific project—but still need care.  

**Goal:**
Assign clear ownership of important cross-functional themes that affect product quality long-term.  

**How It Works:**

1. Define cross-project “topics” such as:
    - UX consistency
    - Documentation quality
    - Component library maintenance
    - Performance / speed
    - Testing standards
    - Accessibility
2. Assign a Topic Owner for each one:
    - Doesn’t require full-time work
    - Person is the go-to reference and quality gate
    - Can suggest improvements, propose standards, or flag risks
3. Maintain a “Topic Ownership Map” in Notion with:
    - Topic name
    - Owner
    - Scope and related responsibilities
    - Related project connections
4. Provide a Starter Kit for new Topic Owners including:
    - Scope
    - Tools
    - Expectations

**Benefits:**

* Ensures neglected areas are cared for
* Distributes accountability
* Creates internal champions for quality and culture

#### 👣 Process 34 – Follow-Up Structure for "Not Now" Ideas  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Executive, General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
During planning, calls, or execution, high-value ideas often emerge—but if they’re not immediately actionable, they get lost or forgotten.  
They disappear into Slack threads, mental notes, or are replaced by more urgent tasks.  

**Goal:**
Create a structured system to preserve, revisit, and activate ideas that are valuable, but not urgent.  

**How It Works:**

1. Every idea that’s “not for now” is added to a “Later” section
    - A shared Notion space or ClickUp list called: 📂 Incubation / Later Ideas
    - Each entry includes:
    - Short description of the idea
    - Why it matters
    - Status: “to revisit”, “needs validation”, “pending alignment”
    - Suggested timeframe or trigger condition
2. Temporary Owner Assigned:
    - Usually the person closest to the idea: Lead Dev, UX Lead, PM
    - Their job is only to ensure the idea is kept alive—not to execute it now
3. Monthly Ritual:
    - On the last Friday of every month, the CEO or PM hosts a 15–30 min async or live review
    - Ideas are evaluated: archive, promote, or keep in incubation

**Tools:**
Notion board or ClickUp list → Slack reminders  

**Benefits:**

* Protects strategic thinking from being lost in urgency
* Creates a backlog of innovation opportunities
* Enables better long-term planning and roadmap development

#### 🔄 Process 60 – Recorded Meetings with Tags & Timepoints

**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Loom, MeetGeek, NAS & Drive, Notion, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Not everyone can attend every meeting, and important takeaways are often lost or buried.  

**Goal:**
Record all key meetings and tag topics and highlights for fast review and future access.  

**How It Works:**

* Weekly reviews, retrospectives, CEO briefings, and demos are recorded via Loom or Google Meet
* After the meeting, meeting organnizers add:
    - Tags: e.g., “UX Decision”, “Timeline Change”, “Tech Debt”
    - Timestamped summary in Notion
* Each recording is saved under the relevant project or in a shared “Meeting Archive”

**Tools:**
Loom or Google Meet → Notion  

**Benefits:**

* Allows async alignment
* Supports accountability and review
* Saves time for those who can’t attend live

#### 🧠 Process 61 – “Meeting to Action” via MeetGeek + Tines  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, MeetGeek, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 17, 20, 63, 65  

**Context & Problem:**
Even when meetings are productive, the resulting actions are often lost, untracked, or unclear.  

**Goal:**
Automatically extract tasks and assign them after every recorded meeting.  

**How It Works:**

1. Meeting is recorded with MeetGeek
2. MeetGeek transcribes and summarizes the meeting
3. Tines reads the transcript → detects action points and creates:
    - Task in ClickUp
    - Assigned Owner
    - Due date
    - Link to transcript snippet
4. Team lead quickly reviews and approves task list

**Tools:**
MeetGeek → Tines → ClickUp

**Tools:** ClickUp, MeetGeek, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 17, 20, 61, 63  

**Context & Problem:**
The CEO’s time in meetings is valuable—but often diluted by vague discussions or unclear outcomes.  

**Goal:**
Maximize the impact of CEO involvement by structuring and tagging meetings intelligently.  

**How It Works:**

1. Any meeting involving the CEO is:
    - Recorded
    - Transcribed and tagged (MeetGeek)
2. Action points triggered by the CEO become:
    - Tasks in ClickUp
    - Assigned with due dates
    - Linked to transcript highlight
3. Summary is shared only with operational teams

**Tools:**
MeetGeek → Tines → ClickUp  

**Benefits:**

* No more repetition

* Teams follow up quickly with clarity

#### 🧪 Process 67 – Monthly Team Idea Lab  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Daily ops leave no space for innovation. Great ideas die in the backlog.  

**Goal:**
Create a recurring, protected space for team-driven innovation, experimentation, and naming.  

**How It Works:**

1. Once a month, each team gets ½ day Idea Lab
2. Members can:
    - Propose a new feature or experiment
    - Work on a prototype
    - Suggest improvements or new naming conventions
3. Ideas are submitted to a shared Notion board with:
    - Title
    - Vision

**Tools:**
Notion Board → Slack voting → PM triage  

**Benefits:**

* Brings creativity into the process
* Surfaces hidden innovation
* Gives teams ownership of product evolution

#### 🔗 Process 78 – "Point of Truth" per Area  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
With too many tools and versions, no one knows which data is reliable.  
Different teams use different sources for the same thing.  

**Goal:**
Establish a single source of truth for each company domain.  
“If it’s not there, it’s not real.”  

**How It Works:**

1. Define one platform or space per department:
    - 📈 Sales → HubSpot
    - 🛠 Dev roadmap → ClickUp
    - 🎨 Design system → Figma library
    - 🧠 Strategy → Notion master page
2. Create a Notion page: Company Points of Truth
    - Lists each department
    - Links the official tool
    - Names the person responsible for updates

**Benefits:**

* Cuts confusion
* Aligns teams on a shared version of reality
* Encourages documentation discipline

Onboarding  

#### 🎥 Process 137 – Bimonthly Progress Loom from PMs  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
It’s hard for the CEO, leads, and stakeholders to get a visual sense of how a project is evolving—especially when updates are buried in text or tasks.  

**Goal:**
Create short, regular, visual progress reports that bring clarity and visibility to strategic initiatives.  

**How It Works:**

* Every 2 weeks, the PM records a 3-minute Loom video covering:
    - What was done since the last update
    - What's coming next
    - Current risks, blockers, or support needed
* The Loom is saved in the project folder and shared with:
    - CEO
    - Leadership
    - Investors (if applicable)

Tools: Loom + Notion folder  

**Benefits:**

* Gives context beyond checklists
* Scales communication across teams
* Improves stakeholder trust and alignment

#### 📢 Process 156 – Flash Updates Between Departments and PM  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Strategic updates or risks from teams don’t reach the PM in time, leading to bad assumptions or late reactions.  

**Goal:**
Establish a short weekly ritual where each department shares one quick update with the PM.  

**How It Works:**

* Every Wednesday or Friday, each team lead sends a 1-paragraph update via:
    - Slack
    - Voice message
    - Short written Loom if needed
* Topics include:
    - Delivery status
    - Risks
    - Important decisions or client input
* Tines logs updates into a “PM Weekly Summary” database

**Tools:**
Slack + Notion (auto-logged via Tines)  

**Benefits:**

* Short, async alignment
* No meetings required
* Continuous awareness without micromanagement

#### 📍 Process 159 – Mandatory Read Confirmation for Strategic Info  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
When PMs share specs or decisions, they don’t know if leads have read them—causing risk of silent misalignment.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a standard “confirmation of receipt” ritual for critical communications.  

**How It Works:**

* Every key piece of info (Slack, task, Notion doc) includes a note:
    - “Please confirm by reacting ✅ or commenting 'Read'”
* Tines tracks interactions:
    - If no reply within 48h → Slack reminder
    - Optionally, tag the department lead and PMO

**Tools:**
Slack + Tines tracking  

**Benefits:**

* Traceable acknowledgment
* Enforces accountability
* Avoids “I missed that” errors

#### 🗓️ Process 191 – Assigned Reviewer for Periodic Updates  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** HR  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 183, 193, 194  

**Context & Problem:**
Important documents go untouched for months or years because nobody is responsible for reviewing them.  

**Goal:**
Assign a Review Owner and automate reminders for regular updates.  

**How It Works:**

* Every strategic document has:
    - 📋 Review Owner
    - 📅 Next Review Date
* Tines sends a Slack/Email alert:
    - If the review is overdue
    - Or to confirm the document is still valid

**Benefits:**

* Maintains content health
* Prevents silent drift
* Easy to distribute responsibility

#### 📘 Process 211 – Audit/M&A Documentation Package  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Team Leads & Managers

**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Strategic projects often lack a ready-to-use documentation set for investors, due diligence, or external partners.  

**Goal:**
Ensure every strategic project maintains an Audit Ready Folder for external visibility when needed.  

**How It Works:**

* For each strategic initiative, the PM creates an Audit Ready Folder containing:
    - 📝 Executive summary (project pitch in <1 page)
    - ✅ Completed milestones
    - 🐞 Key bug reports + resolution logs
    - 📄 Signed contracts, SoWs, and client-approved release forms
* Folder is stored on the NAS and linked to a Notion index

**Category:** Quality & Control  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** 214, 215, 219, 220  

**Context & Problem:**
Decisions (UX, naming, features) are blocked for days because the client never replies.  

**Goal:**
Set a fixed timeout window after which silence = implicit approval.  

**How It Works:**

* PM notifies the client:
    - “You have 3–5 working days to respond. After this, your silence will be considered approval.”
* Each timeout is tracked in a Client Silent Approvals.csv
* Used for:
    - Text confirmations
    - Bug handling
    - Flow sign-offs

**Benefits:**

* Keeps project moving
* Transparent and documented
* Avoids fake misunderstandings later

**Goal:**
Log all incomplete mapping sessions and immediately plan recovery.  

**How It Works:**

* Each session log includes a field: Session Interrupted?
* If checked:
    - Provide reason: ❌ Technical issue, 🔐 Access denied, ⏰ Time expired
    - List incomplete areas
* The PM:
    - Reassigns the task to another mapper
    - Creates a recovery entry in the task tracker
* Logged in: Mission Outcome Log (Notion)

**Benefits:**

* Clear visibility on unfinished work
* Fast reassignment
* Zero area is forgotten

**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Staff (security, reception) may not know who you are or why you're on-site, creating tension.  

**Goal:**
Equip mappers with a friendly, professional interaction script to introduce themselves.  

Script Includes:  

* 🗣️ “Good morning, we’re the team assigned by [client/org] for…”
* ✅ “We’ll be quiet, fast, and stick to authorized areas only”
