#### 🔁 Process 9 – Always-On Project Timeline (Project History View)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Development, Executive, Marketing, PM, Sales  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 44  

**Goal:**
Give every project a structured visual timeline that tracks its evolution from kickoff to release.  

Actors Involved:  
PMs (curate the timeline), Devs/UX (flag changes), CEO/Stakeholders (review progress)  

**Tools:**

* Notion Timeline or FigJam board (embed into project doc)
* (Optional): Miro / Whimsical for design-oriented projects

🔧 How It Works:  

* A timeline board is created in the project Notion space (or embedded from FigJam)
* It visually records:
    - 📌 Key decisions (e.g., pivot, approval, shift in direction)
    - 🚧 Critical bug resolutions
    - ✅ Milestones reached (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Final)
    - 💡 Strategic moments (client feedback, internal review outcomes)
* Entries are brief, timestamped, and ideally linked to related tasks or documents.

Purpose:  

* Helps onboard new team members fast
* Offers transparent story for investor/client presentations
* Creates historical context for future planning or retrospectives

Frequency:  
Updated at every significant event or review point  
Reviewed weekly by PMs  

#### 💬 Process 32 – Standard Project Closing Message (Celebration + Recap)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Forms, Loom, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Many projects end quietly, with no sense of closure, recognition, or documented final reflection.  
This weakens culture, motivation, and learning.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a standard project closing ritual that gives every release or delivery:  

* A proper wrap-up
* A visible announcement
* A moment to reflect and improve

**How It Works:**

1. When a project is officially closed:
    - PM or Owner records a short Loom Recap Video (1–3 minutes)

→ What was delivered, key challenges, major learnings  

2. Send a Slack message to a dedicated channel (e.g. #releases):

less  
CopyEdit  

🎉 Project [Project Name] has been officially closed!  

3. Here’s what’s included:
4. - 📄 Docs: [Notion link]
5. - 🎥 Loom Recap: [Loom link]
6. - 🗣️ Feedback Form: [Notion Form]
7. Thanks to everyone involved!
8. 

9. Trigger a Feedback Form:
    - Lightweight, async form with 3–5 questions:
    - What went well?
    - What didn’t work?
    - Any suggestions for the next project?

**Tools:**
Loom → Notion → Slack → Notion Form (or Typeform)  

**Benefits:**

* Gives closure and recognition
* Builds a learning loop for future projects
* Improves documentation quality
* Reinforces a strong, transparent culture

**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** 9  

**Context & Problem:**
Project Managers are overwhelmed with execution, but leadership lacks a simple overview of strategic project status.  

**Goal:**
Create a high-level, executive-friendly board focused on project health and direction—not microtasks.  

**How It Works:**

1. A shared Asana board lists all strategic projects with:
    - 📊 Project Name
    - 🟢 Status: On Track / Slipping / Blocked
    - ⏳ % Completion
    - 👤 Owner
    - 📍 Next Key Milestone
2. PMs update the board twice per week
3. Tines sends a digest every Monday and Thursday to CEO, Leads, and Stakeholders via Slack or Email

**Tools:**
Asana (milestone-only board) + Tines automation  

**Benefits:**

* Clear strategic visibility
* Reduces the need for status calls
* Empowers decision-making without micromanagement

#### 🛡️ Process 74 – “Emergency Plan” Section in Every Project

**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability, Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
If a key person disappears, gets sick, or resigns, projects stall and knowledge is lost.  

**Goal:**
Create a lightweight business continuity plan for every project—focused only on essentials.  

**How It Works:**

1. In each project’s Notion or ClickUp space, add a section called “📛 Emergency Access”
2. It includes:
    - 🔍 Current status (last update, current blocker, open questions)
    - 👥 Backup contacts / alternate owners
    - 📂 Where to find docs, code, credentials (links only)
    - 📆 Date of last review/update
3. PMs or leads are responsible for keeping this updated at each milestone or handover

**Tools:**
Notion embedded section → Template → Slack reminder every 60 days  

**Benefits:**

* Ensures continuity in case of absence
* Reduces risk of single-point failure
* Easy for others to step in when needed

**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** MeetGeek, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects involving multiple teams often begin with poor alignment, unclear ownership, and late-stage misunderstandings.  

**Goal:**
Establish a fast, visual kickoff format to align all teams before execution starts.  

**How It Works:**

1. For projects involving 2+ departments, kickoff includes:
    - A FigJam or Notion board visualizing:
    - Objectives
    - Flow/sequence
    - Owners per phase
    - Risks or open questions
2. A 30-minute kickoff call is held:
    - Each team gives input
    - Conflicts are resolved early
    - All comments are added directly on the board
3. The call is:
    - Recorded with MeetGeek
    - Anyone who misses it must leave a comment or a 60-sec Loom follow-up by EOD

**Tools:**
FigJam / Notion + MeetGeek + Slack  
Effect:  

* Shared understanding before execution
* Minimal time investment
* Fewer misaligned assumptions later in the project

#### 📌 Process 130 – PM Strategic Dashboard by Priority

**Category:** Documentation, Quality & Control  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs manage too many projects across different statuses and don’t have a clear overview of what’s critical vs. on hold.  

**Goal:**
Give each PM a dashboard grouped by project priority & impact.  

**Structure:**

* 🟥 Critical → Client-facing or urgent launches
* 🟨 Active → Internal builds
* 🟦 Standby → Waiting for input or paused

Each project block shows:

**Category:** Planning & Strategy, Quality & Control  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Risks are only reported when they’ve already caused problems.  

**Goal:**
Make risk reporting proactive and structured across every project.  

**How It Works:**

* Each project has a 🔺 Current Risks box in Notion
    - Examples: delays, blockers, team availability, technical uncertainty
* If a risk is marked open for more than 72 hours, Tines triggers:
    - Slack ping to lead team
    - Optional follow-up with PM

**Benefits:**

* Early awareness of threats
* Forces shared ownership
* Helps resolve before escalation

#### 🎯 Process 133 – “Ready to Build” Alignment Doc  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development  
**Category:** Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Dev and UX often begin execution without a shared, validated scope.  

**Goal:**
Every strategic feature starts only when a Ready to Build doc is created by a PM or UX lead and approved.  

**What It Includes:**

* Project goal in 2 sentences
* Success metrics
* Stakeholders involved
* Dependencies and blockers
* Expected handoff flow

The file must be acknowledged by Dev, UX, and QA before work begins.  

**Tools:**
Notion + ClickUp + Standard template  

**Benefits:**

* Less rework
* Aligned delivery expectations
* Faster and cleaner execution

#### 📄 Process 135 – Complete “Project Folder” for Every Initiative  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** General, NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**

Folder Structure:  

* 🧭 Vision + Brief
* 🎨 UX (Figma link)
* 🛠️ Dev (tech specs, endpoints)
* 🧪 QA checklist
* 📣 Marketing plan + pitch
* 📦 Final delivery link + Loom

**Tools:**
Notion or Google Drive → Duplicated on kickoff  

**Benefits:**

* No more “where is the doc?”
* Clean collaboration entry point
* Supports client handovers, investor showcases

#### 📢 Process 136 – Automated Stakeholder Comms (Internal & External)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, General, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs spend too much time manually updating stakeholders about milestone progress.  

**Goal:**
Automate key milestone communication without extra work.  

**How It Works:**

* Each milestone completion triggers a Tines flow:
    - For external: client email update
    - For internal: Slack update in #product / #client
    - For leadership: status update on CEO’s Asana or Notion view

**Tools:**
Tines + Slack + Notion + Email (SendGrid or native SMTP)  

**Benefits:**

* No duplicated effort
* Reliable updates
* Keeps everyone in sync without extra pings

#### 🧠 Process 138 – Operational Rules per Project  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Each team manages projects differently, which causes confusion, unclear ownership, and broken rituals.  

**Goal:**
Create a shared “how we operate” page per project, with basic rules and expectations set upfront.  

**How It Works:**

* At project kickoff, the PM creates a Notion page listing:
    - 📍 Official Slack channel
    - 👤 Who makes decisions (per area)
    - 📄 Where documentation lives
    - 🔁 Active rituals (weekly stand-up, Friday update, etc.)
* Each team member must read and acknowledge this page

Tools: Notion + Slack  

**Benefits:**

* Clarifies roles and flow
* Makes onboarding into the project easier
* Reduces friction and overlaps

#### 📘 Process 139 – Project Retrospective + Lessons Learned  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** MeetGeek, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects end, but teams jump into the next one without reflecting on what worked and what didn’t.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a light, structured retrospective at the end of each mid-to-large project.  

**How It Works:**

* After every project longer than 2 weeks, the PM schedules:
    - A short live retro
    - Or an async form shared via Slack or Notion
* The output is stored as:
    - ✅ What worked
    - ❌ What didn’t
    - ➡️ What we’ll do differently next time
* Linked to the project folder

Tools: Notion + Slack + MeetGeek (optional)  

**Benefits:**

* Preserves learning
* Avoids repeating mistakes
* Strengthens team alignment over time

#### 📊 Process 140 – Weekly Project Health Score  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Executive, PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Forms, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
There’s no ongoing visibility on how “healthy” a project is—not just in terms of delivery, but in clarity, morale, and risk.  

**Goal:**
Have each PM submit a weekly health check for their projects, which feeds into a dashboard.  

Scoring Criteria (1–5):  

* 🔍 Clarity (Do we know what to do?)
* 💬 Communication (Is everyone aligned?)
* ⚠️ Risk (Any blockers or red flags?)
* 🔥 Team Engagement (Are people present, motivated?)
* Data is visualized in Notion and flagged via Tines if scores drop

Tools: Tines + Notion Form + Notion  

**Benefits:**

* Early risk detection
* Weekly alignment
* Combines emotion + metrics

#### 🧱 Process 142 – Feasibility Window Response System  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, Hupsot, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** 141, 143  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients demand unrealistic delivery times, and teams don’t know how to reply without saying a flat “no.”  

**Goal:**
Build a transparent, option-based response framework for timing negotiation.  

**How It Works:**
For each client request, PM defines 3 timelines:  

* 🔴 Minimum time (if team drops everything)
* 🟡 Focused time (with priority shift)
* 🟢 Realistic time (within roadmap)

The client receives all 3 options, with trade-offs noted (quality, roadmap impact).  
Tools: Slack / Email / HubSpot templates  

**Benefits:**

* Builds client trust
* Gives PM leverage
* Protects roadmap and internal balance

#### 🗓️ Process 143 – Client Calendar with Reasoned Shifts  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** 141, 142  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients get upset when timelines change—but often, they don't see the internal logic or alternatives.  

**Goal:**
Keep clients aligned and proactive by sharing a mini calendar view of project health and timing.  

**How It Works:**

* PM shares a simplified calendar (PDF or Notion page) with:
    - Milestones
    - Current risk areas
    - Alternative delivery proposals

(e.g., deliver Phase 1 now, Phase 2 in 10 days)  

* Calendar is updated weekly and accessible in read-only format

**Benefits:**

* Demonstrates transparency
* Eases frustration during delays
* Makes PMs more credible in front of clients

#### 📉 Process 144 – “Backfire Sheet” for Risky Deliveries  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Email, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Sometimes, clients insist on a release date even when the team knows it’s rushed or incomplete.  

**Goal:**
Document the consequences of accepting premature delivery so the risk is visible to everyone—including the client.  

**How It Works:**

* When a risky deadline is accepted, PM fills a Backfire Sheet:
    - What corners are being cut?
    - Is QA reduced?
    - Is documentation incomplete?
    - What might go wrong?
* Sheet is saved in the project folder and optionally shared with the client

Tools: Notion template  

**Benefits:**

* Makes trade-offs explicit
* Protects team in case of post-launch issues
* Useful for negotiation and accountability

#### 📢 Process 145 – “Shared Expectations Letter” at Kickoff  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Signature Tools  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Unspoken client expectations cause friction later—especially around response times, scope, or revision rounds.  

**Goal:**
Set explicit boundaries and shared commitments at project start.  

**How It Works:**

* PM prepares a document outlining:
    - 🕒 Response times
    - 🔁 Revision limits
    - 📅 Project phases
    - 👤 Decision-making process
* Document is signed by the client digitally and archived

Tools: Notion + PDF export + eSignature  

**Benefits:**

* Prevents conflict
* Speeds up escalations
* Clarifies what is (and isn’t) included

#### 🔁 Process 146 – “No/But/When” Response to Client Requests  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication, Other  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, Hupsot, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Saying “yes” to everything creates chaos; saying “no” creates tension.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a structured way to say “no” constructively.  

**How It Works:**
For each impossible request, the response follows 3 parts:  

* ❌ No: "That won’t be feasible as requested..."
* ✅ But: "We can offer an alternative that’s more sustainable..."
* 📅 When: "And we could deliver it by [realistic date]"

Templates are used in Slack, Email, or HubSpot  

**Benefits:**

* Protects team
* Maintains client relationship
* Builds negotiation skillset internally

#### 📊 Process 147 – “Client Impact Tracker” on Internal Roadmap  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Internal teams don’t know how much of their time is diverted by client-specific requests.  

**Goal:**
Track the cost of accepted client work on internal delivery.  

**How It Works:**

* Every accepted client request is tagged as CUSTOM-CLIENT
* Linked to an internal task it affects
* Tines logs:
    - Days delayed
    - Tasks postponed or shifted
    - Teams involved
* A monthly report shows "client impact cost" → used in client review or planning

**Benefits:**

* Makes roadmap trade-offs visible
* Supports prioritization discussions
* Creates negotiating leverage

#### 🔍 Process 149 – Post-Call Clarification Memo  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, MeetGeek, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
High-pressure or confusing client calls often end with verbal commitments no one remembers—or misinterprets.  

**Goal:**
Create a short written recap after unclear or critical calls, shared and archived.  

**How It Works:**

* After the call, PM creates a 3-point memo:
    - What was actually requested?
    - What was explicitly agreed upon?
    - What requires internal alignment?
* Memo is sent to the client for confirmation + saved in project folder

Tools: MeetGeek + Notion or PDF export  

**Benefits:**

* Reduces misalignment
* Protects both sides
* Documents the “real story” of complex interactions

#### 🎤 Process 150 – Public Record of Client Request Outcomes  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, Marketing, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Internal teams don’t know which client requests were accepted, declined, or why.  

**Goal:**
Create a shared internal dashboard of client request outcomes.  

**How It Works:**

* PM maintains a Notion page called Client Request Tracker
* Each entry shows:
    - ✅ Accepted – in progress
    - ⏳ Under review
    - ❌ Declined – with reasoning
* Dashboard is visible to Dev, UX, Marketing, and updated weekly

**Benefits:**

* Improves cross-team transparency
* Reduces assumptions and tension
* Makes client response strategy collaborative

#### 🤝 Process 151 – “Project Alliance” Between PM and Department Leads  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Project Managers often request information or commitment from department leads but receive vague, incomplete, or delayed responses—especially when there's no agreed way of working together.  

**Goal:**
Establish a lightweight but clear operational agreement between the PM and all involved team leads before each execution phase begins. This ensures shared ownership and expectations from day one.  

🔧 How It Works:  

1. At the start of each project (before active development begins), the PM creates a shared page in Notion titled “Project Alliance”.
2. The page outlines:
    - 🔹 Key roles and responsibilities per team
    - 💬 Preferred communication method (Slack thread, async form, or short check-ins)
    - 📆 Intermediate deadlines and key checkpoints
    - 🔄 How updates and escalation will be handled
3. Each involved lead (Dev, UX, QA, Sales, etc.) reviews and agrees on the content.
4. The agreement is approved informally via:
    - Slack reaction (✅)
    - Short comment
    - Optional email confirmation
5. The “Project Alliance” is:
    - Pinned in the Notion project folder
    - Shared in the main Slack project channel for visibility

📎 Example Use Case:  
A project involving Dev, UX, and QA:  

* Dev agrees to respond within 24h to blockers
* UX agrees to complete revisions before the start of implementation
* QA agrees to send test coverage plans before delivery reviews
* The PM agrees to summarize status every Friday and flag risks via Slack

**Tools:**
Notion (Project Alliance template) + Slack thread + optional Slack reminder via Tines  

**Benefits:**

* Clear expectations before execution
* Fewer miscommunications during delivery
* Stronger sense of partnership and accountability
* Easy to refer back if conflicts arise

#### 📄 Process 152 – Per-Department Info Checklist (Completed by Leads)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Forms, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs waste time chasing fragmented inputs from each department. Everyone provides different levels of detail, in different formats, at different times.  

**Goal:**
Create a standardized checklist per department that team leads must fill out for each new project before execution begins.  

**How It Works:**

* A structured checklist is prepared for each function (Notion form, Notion Form, or ClickUp form):
    - Dev: Required time, technical risks, dependencies, resource availability
    - UX: Figma status, number of revisions planned, expected handoff date
    - QA: Key risk zones, configuration needs, testing tools, and test window
* The PM shares the form with team leads during the project setup phase
* The completed checklists are:
    - Saved in the shared Notion project space
    - Visible to CEO and PMO for transparency
    - Reviewed before assigning timelines or deliverables

**Tools:**
ClickUp Form or Notion DB + Slack notification  

**Benefits:**

* Predictable inputs from all teams
* Fast scoping with fewer assumptions
* CEO and PMO have visibility from the start

#### 🗣️ Process 153 – Focused Check-in Calls Only Between PM and Team Leads  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Team Leads & Managers  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, MeetGeek, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Project meetings include too many people, waste time, and blur decision-making. PMs get feedback from team members without strategic context.  

**Goal:**
Limit operational and planning conversations to PM + Department Leads only—in short, high-signal check-ins.  

**How It Works:**

* PM schedules 15-minute alignment calls with:
    - Dev Lead
    - UX Lead
    - QA Lead
    - Other relevant leads
* These check-ins:
    - Replace broad team calls
    - Focus on risks, dependencies, and upcoming deliverables
    - Are recorded via MeetGeek if others need to listen later
* Leads collect feedback from their teams and report insights

**Tools:**
Google Calendar + MeetGeek + Slack follow-up  

**Benefits:**

* Tighter, faster sync
* Less interruption for operational teams
* Information flows through leadership, not noise

#### 🧠 Process 158 – Private Project Slack Channels with Focused Access  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
When everyone is in the same Slack project channel, things get noisy, diluted, and hard to track.  

**Goal:**
Create private project Slack channels that include only PM + key department leads.  

**How It Works:**

* For every active project:
    - A Slack channel is created: #proj-[name]-pm-devlead-uxlead
* The channel is used for:
    - High-level strategy
    - Status updates
    - Decisions and documentation links
* Broader team updates are shared weekly in public product channels

**Benefits:**

* Reduces information noise
* Clear thread of decisions
* Protects operational team focus

#### 📝 Process 160 – Co-Signed Document Before Execution Phase  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Teams often begin execution without shared clarity on goals, responsibilities, and what “done” means.  

**Goal:**
Require a jointly signed agreement between the PM and each department lead before starting any execution phase.  

**How It Works:**

* Before execution begins, the PM prepares a “Phase Agreement” in Notion:
    - 🎯 Objectives
    - ✅ What defines completion
    - 👤 Owner per deliverable
    - ⚠️ Known risks or blockers
    - 📆 Key timing and checkpoints
* Each team lead adds a comment or emoji to confirm
* Link is shared in the project Slack thread
* Stored in the Notion project folder

**Benefits:**

* Eliminates ambiguity
* Creates shared accountability
* Helps PM manage follow-ups with clarity

#### 🔍 Process 164 – “In Scope / Out of Scope” Table (Publicly Visible)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Deployment & Delivery, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients request changes or additions that were never part of the agreement—creating conflict.  

**Goal:**
Maintain a side-by-side scope visibility document, accessible to internal teams and clients.  

**How It Works:**

* The PM creates a 2-column table:
    - ✅ In Scope: listed deliverables and commitments
    - ❌ Out of Scope: anything explicitly excluded or not agreed upon
* Shared at project kickoff and updated if anything changes
* Linked in the project folder and optionally embedded in the contract

Tools: Notion Table or PDF
