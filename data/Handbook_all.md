# Introduction

This document represents a strategic effort to refine, consolidate, and optimize the internal operational processes of Hidonix inc., considering the unique configuration of the company's structure, geographic setup, and current team dynamics.

The goal is to offer clarity, consistency, and speed in execution, while preserving flexibility where needed. This handbook is not designed to introduce bureaucracy, but rather to enable autonomy through structure, ensuring that all departments and teams- - across time zones- - can operate with aligned priorities and traceable responsibilities.

# $\mathfrak{S}$  Dual Headquarters and Time Zone Coordination

Hidonix Inc operates across two main operational hubs, each with distinct strategic roles:

- Los Angeles, California (USA)  Serves as the Global Headquarters, encompassing:

- Executive Leadership  
- Business Operations  
- Sales & Business Development  
- Marketing & Communications  
- Legal & Finance  
- A small software and robotics development unit, focused on high-impact, territory-specific technologies and strategic R&D initiatives aligned with U.S. partners and institutions

# - Catania, Italy (EU)

Functions as the company's Primary Research & Development Hub, hosting:

- The core software engineering team  
- Units for AI, computer vision, and robotics research

- Product testing and experimental prototyping- A support mapping team that frequently travels to assist operations in the U.S.

The 9- hour time difference requires careful asynchronous planning and cross- functional accountability. This handbook defines the mechanisms for bridging operational efforts and aligning shared priorities across both continents.

# Departments and Tools in Use

All current departments are considered in this process redesign:

- Executive / CEO Office- Product Development (Engineering, AI, CV, Backend, Frontend)- Project Management- Sales and Business Development- Marketing and Communications- Legal & Finance- Human Resources & People Operations- Tech Support / Field Teams / Mapping Units

Tools actively in use include:

- Figma (UX/UI Analysis)- ClickUp (Development Tasks, Sprint Management)- Asana (High-level Planning, PM Visibility)- Zendesk (Customer Ticketing)

- Loom (Internal/External Tutorials)- Notion (Documentations/ company information)- EZOfficeInventory (Inventory and Asset Management)- MeetGeek (Meeting Transcriptions and Summaries)- Slack (Internal Communication)- Google Drive + NAS Repository (Document Sharing & Archiving)- Make (Automations)

# Real Roles vs. Nominal Titles

This review is based not just on job titles, but on the actual responsibilities and workflow ownership of everyone. Clarity between who decides, who executes, and who supports is critical to reducing bottlenecks and improving accountability.

- The CEO defines the product vision, functionality, and direction- UX/UI team serves as product analysts- Project Managers act as execution enablers, not product owners

This structure requires strong documentation and deliberate communication, especially in the early stages of any new internal initiative.

# Need for Lean but Solid Documentation

Documentation must remain:

- Clear and accessible- Visible across departments

# Traceable by responsibility

# Modular, so it can evolve over time

We do not aim for long reports; we aim for documents that enable clarity, reduce errors, and support accountability without slowing execution.

# Strong Direction, Then Autonomy

Every project or process must start with a clear, strategic direction- - defined primarily by the CEO or executive leadership. Once this direction is shared:

Teams must take ownership Project and Product Managers must follow up and ensure consistency Departments must collaborate without needing constant oversight

# Purpose of This Handbook:

The Hidonix Handbook of Internal Processes is a living, working document designed to bring clarity, cohesion, and accountability to our operations across departments and continents.

Its mission is simple but strategic:

To define how we work together, regardless of location or role To make expectations explicit, not assumed To ensure that decisions, responsibilities, and execution paths are clear To streamline communication and reduce friction, while respecting team autonomy

This is not a theoretical manual. It is meant to be used daily, referenced frequently, and updated periodically.

The stronger the structure, the more freedom and confidence each team can have in execution.

This handbook is particularly relevant as Hidonix operates across different time zones, without a dedicated Product Manager, and in a fast- moving, innovation- heavy environment. Its goal is to prevent confusion before it happens and accelerate alignment before it's needed.

# Chapter 1: General Processes

These general processes will be assigned to everyone in the company, regardless of role, department, or title.

# Process G1 - Strategic Color Coding Across Tools

# Context & Problem:

It's hard to distinguish immediately what's core, strategic, or experimental across tools.

# Goal:

Adopt a shared color- coding system to quickly understand priority and category.

# Color Key:

- Blue = Core business- Orange = Strategic feature- Grey = Experiment/test- Red = Urgent/blocker

# Used across:

- ClickUp task tags- Notion pages- Figma files- Slack labels

# Effect:

- Instant visual clarity

Cross- tool consistency

Less need to read everything to understand priority

# Process G2 - Visual Validation Tag for Operational Documents

# Context & Problem:

People use outdated or unapproved documents as reference—causing delivery errors or scope creep.

# Goal:

Visually mark every operational or technical document with its validation status.

# How It Works:

Each document has a visual header or tag including:

- Validated- Owner: [Name]- Review by: [Next review date]

Documents without this tag cannot be used for:

- Development- QA- Contractual decisions

Applicable to scopes, test plans, flows, deliverables

# Benefits:

- Clear source of truth

- Reduces confusion- Encourages doc quality before execution

# Process G3 - Async Micro-Audio Feedback

# Context & Problem:

Writing detailed replies sometimes feels heavy or overly formal, especially for nuanced feedback.

# Goal:

Allow team members to send short, 30- second audio replies for fast clarification or contextual feedback.

# How It Works:

Via Slack or Loom, users can:

Record a voice note (max 30- 45s)- Add transcript automatically (optional)- Tag the message in the appropriate thread

Especially useful for UX reviews, dev walkthroughs, or QA context

# Benefits:

- More human and expressive feedback- Saves time writing- Perfect for async clarification

# Process G4 - All Approval Procedures Must Be Respected

# Context & Problem:

Skipping approvals—even for small items—can lead to misalignment, bugs, or reputational issues.

# Obligation:

Obligation:No delivery, release, or client handoff can happen without the required approvals.

# Checklist:

PM or department lead confirms via Slack or email QA process completed if relevant All necessary documents are reviewed and signed

# Why This Matters:

Prevents last- minute errors Ensures professional standards Reinforces process discipline

# Process G5 - Employees Must Stay Updated on the Tools They Use

# Context & Problem:

Too often, employees underperform or make mistakes due to poor understanding of tools.

Obligation: Everyone must learn and keep up- to- date with the software and platforms required in their role.

# What This Includes:

Proactively reviewing onboarding kits and Loom tutorials Keeping up with tool updates

- Asking for clarification when needed—but not expecting everything to be taught passively

# Why This Matters:

- Maintains operational excellence- Encourages self-sufficiency- Avoids tool misuse and inefficiencies

# Process G6 – Every Employee Must Contribute to a Positive Work Atmosphere

# Context & Problem:

A negative attitude—even in silence—can affect team morale and overall culture.

# Obligation:

You are not just expected to avoid causing problems—you are expected to actively contribute to a respectful and constructive environment.

# Expected Behavior:

- Speak with clarity and kindness- Avoid sarcasm or passive-aggressive comments- Step up when a teammate needs support, even outside your role

# Why This Matters:

- Builds a collaborative and healthy culture

- Encourages psychological safety

- Strengthens team resilience

# Process G7 - Company Priorities Take Precedence Over Personal Choices

# Context & Problem:

Employees sometimes prioritize side tasks or personal delivery goals over high- priority company work.

# Obligation:

When priorities conflict, align with your lead or PM- - don't decide unilaterally.

# Examples:

Fixing a bug instead of preparing a critical release Doing client work while ignoring internal deliverables Pausing a task because something "feels more urgent"

# Why This Matters:

Ensures strategic focus Avoids internal conflict Builds decision- making based on alignment

# Process G8 - Employees Must Ensure Continuity When Leaving a Project

# Context & Problem:

When someone exits a project, knowledge gaps and lost files cause blockers for others.

# Obligation:

You must leave the project fully documented and ready for someone else to continue.

# What This Means:

Create a Notion or Drive folder with all relevant files Add comments in ClickUp/Slack for unresolved tasks

- Be available for a handover conversation if needed

# Why This Matters:

- Preserves operational memory- Prevents confusion or duplicate work- Makes transitions smoother and faster

# Process G9- Employees Must Actively Ask for Feedback

# Context & Problem:

Waiting passively for feedback slows growth. Not every lead has time to follow up proactively.

# Obligation:

You must ask for feedback after meaningful contributions—not wait for it to come.

# When To Ask:

- After you complete an important task or delivery- After a demo, handoff, or retro- If you're unsure about how something landed

Even a short "Is there anything I could improve next time?" goes a long way.

# Why This Matters:

- Drives personal development

- Reduces blind spots

- Encourages open feedback loops

# Process G10 - Ask for Help Promptly When Blocked

# Context & Problem:

Staying stuck in silence creates avoidable bugs, delays, and frustration.

# Obligation:

If you're stuck, you must speak up early—not wait until it's too late.

# What You Should Do:

What You Should Do:- Send a short Slack message: "I'm stuck on X, can we check this together?"- Add a task comment or Loom if needed- No judgment will be made for asking—only for staying silent

# Why This Matters:

Why This Matters:- Reduces technical risk- Prevents stress and burnout- Builds a help- first culture

# Chapter 2: Human Resources Processes

# Section 1: 0-30 Day Onboarding Framework

# Overview (Process 1-5)

At Hidonix, we believe a structured and human- focused onboarding process leads to stronger integration, faster productivity, and a more inclusive team experience. This section outlines the key onboarding milestones and expectations within the first 30 days.

# Slack Welcome + "Hello Team"

As soon as a contract is activated in Factorial, a Slack automation posts a welcome message in #general, introducing the new hire by name, role, and team. New hires are also asked to complete a brief "Hello Team" card (via Notion) sharing:

- Where you're from- What you're passionate about- What you'll be doing at Hidonix

This information is used to post a more personal introduction to the team.

# Week 0: Pre-Onboarding & Day 1 Setup

# Buddy Assignment

Every new hire is paired with an onboarding buddy—typically from the same or a related team. Buddies serve as a go- to resource for day- to- day questions, culture guidance, and onboarding support. Buddy details are stored in Notion and linked in the new hire's Notion onboarding folder. The buddy meets the new hire 3 times in the first 30 days.

# Department-Specific Checklist

Each department maintains a tailored onboarding checklist to ensure new hires receive relevant, hands- on guidance. These checklists are linked from the Notion onboarding hub and must be completed within the first 10 working days. Examples include:

Dev Team: Repository access, dev environment setup, architecture review- UX Team: Figma Design System, UX flow handoffs, product context- Sales Team: CRM (HubSpot) access, pitch decks, shadow client calls- QA Team: Test suite walkthrough, bug tracker orientation, QA training

# Weeks 1-4: Buddy Check-Ins

To ensure ongoing support, onboarding buddies hold three structured check- ins with the new hire:

# Check-In Day Focus Topic

Day 3 First ImpressionsDay 7 Any Blockers?Day 21 Ready to Contribute?

Buddies confirm completion of each check- in in Notion and receive Slack reminders (via Make automation). Buddies who complete all check- ins and receive a positive final review may be recognized publicly or earn a digital badge.

# Day 30:  $360^{\circ}$  Onboarding Review

At the end of the first 30 days, HR facilitates a lightweight  $360^{\circ}$  feedback process to evaluate the onboarding experience from multiple perspectives. Feedback is collected via Google Form from:

The direct manager- The onboarding buddy- The new hire

The review focuses on:

Team integration

- Early contributions- Communication comfort- Any flags or concerns

# Documentation & Sharing:

- Feedback is stored in Notion under the employee's record- Linked in Notion within the onboarding folder- A summary is shared with the CEO and Lead Team via Slack (private)

# Key Tools Used

- Notion: Centralized onboarding hub, checklists, buddy logs- Factorial: HR tracking and employee documentation- Slack: Automated messages, team notifications, reminders- Make: Automation for workflows and reminders- Google Forms: Feedback collection and surveys

# Summary of Benefits

- Custom, relevant onboarding by department

- Built-in social and technical support through buddy system

- Early visibility for the team via warm Slack intros

- Timely feedback loop to address any blockers

- Leadership insight into onboarding effectiveness

# Process 5 - Mandatory Buddy with Tracked Check-ins

# Context & Problem:

New hires often don't know who to talk to or feel unsure about asking questions. This creates isolation and slows integration.

# Goal:

Goal:That's why assigning a dedicated onboarding buddy for the first 30 days, with structured check- ins and trackable support will be beneficial for the new hire.

# How It Works:

How It Works:1. Each new hire is assigned a buddy—usually from the same or a related team.2. 3 required check- ins are scheduled:- Day 3: "First impressions"- Day 7: "Any blockers?"- Day 21: "Ready to contribute?"3. After each check- in:- The buddy fills a short form or confirms the meeting in Notion- Slack reminder sent via Make4. If the buddy completes the full process and gets a positive final review:- They receive public recognition or a badge

# Tools:

Slack  $^+$  Notion  $^+$  Factorial

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Stronger support and culture- Faster integration- Light, measurable mentorship

# Process 6 - "Why Hidonix Works Onsite" Guide for New Hires

# Context & Problem:

Without a strong cultural narrative, new hires may view onsite work as an inconvenience rather than a value.

# Goal:

Goal:Immediately communicate the philosophy and benefits of in- person collaboration during onboarding. It will be included in the welcome pack.

# Contents:

Contents:- Vision: collaboration and informal idea exchange- Benefits for technical quality- Real examples of in- office improvements- Reasoned flexibility  $\neq$  disorganized remote

Included in Welcome Pack

# Process 7 - "What Hidonix Expects from You" Cultural Manifesto

# Context & Problem

Context & ProblemNew hires—and even long- term team members—can lose clarity on what behaviors and mindsets are truly expected at Hidonix. Without a shared reference, expectations remain implicit and unevenly enforced.

# Goal

GoalProvide a clear, concise document outlining Hidonix's core expectations across presence, mindset, and work style—so every team member can align with company culture from day one

# Document Covers

- Daily presence and participation- Proactive contribution and self-management- Collaborative spirit and mutual support- Clear, respectful communication- Ownership, accountability, and follow-through- Distributed at onboarding, included in Welcome Pack- Reviewed and updated annually by HR + CEO for team-wide alignmentBenefits- Reinforces cultural alignment from day one- Prevents ambiguity around "how we work here"- Scales Hidonix values as the team grows

# Benefits

Reinforces cultural alignment from day one Prevents ambiguity around "how we work here" Scales Hidonix values as the team grows

# Process 8 - Personalized Onboarding Starter Kit

- Context & Problem:  New hires get scattered onboarding experiences across Slack, email, and tools.- Goal:  Deliver a personalized, all-in-one onboarding kit automatically when the contract is signed.

# How It Works:

1. When a new hire is added to Factorial: - Notion triggers a welcome kit

2. Kit Includes: 0 Welcome email

Links and access to Slack, ClickUp, Notion, GitHub- CEO Loom introduction- "First 5 days" checklist- Centralized Notion page titled: Welcome [FirstName]

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Professional, smooth start- No missing access- Gives early clarity and motivation

# Process 9 - Product Learning Deadline for New Hires (15 Days)

# Context & Problem:

New hires often lack clear direction on what they need to learn about the Hidonix product suite—causing delays in confident contributions and added pressure on their teammates.

# Rule:

Rule:Every new employee must become product- fluent within their first 15 days at Hidonix.

# What's Required:

What's Required:- Learn the full Hidonix product suite- Understand general architecture (CMS, AI, indoor navigation, etc.)- Watch Loom demos and technical overviews- Complete a basic product knowledge quiz (score  $\geq 80\%$  to pass)

# How It Works:

Built into the onboarding checklist in Notion Quiz completion is logged in Factorial or the onboarding Notion folder Optional reminder: Slackbot pings on Day 10 if quiz not yet completed

# Benefits:

- Accelerates new hire confidence and autonomy

- Reduces dependency on peers for product basics

- Ensures shared language and understanding across teams

# Tools:

- Tools:Notion + Loom + Slackbot (optional) + Factorial

# Process 10 - Mandatory Product Quiz by Day 15

# Context & Problem:

It's not enough to passively review product materials- - product understanding must be actively verified to ensure new hires are truly ready.

# Goal:

Ensure product knowledge is retained, applied, and validated within the first 15 days.

# How It Works:

- Quiz content includes:

- Core features and use cases

Data and workflow structure

Internal terms and vocabulary

Value delivered to clients

Minimum passing score:  $80\%$

Failing score  $\longrightarrow$  mandatory booster module assigned

Completion status is logged in Factorial or onboarding tracker

Optional: Include quiz link in the Notion onboarding folder

# Benefits:

Sets clear expectations early

Confirms understanding of core product elements

Builds accountability and learning confidence

# Tools:

Tools:Notion (quiz link) + Google Forms or Type form + Factorial for logging

# Process 11 - Technical Onboarding for Sales Team (Day 1-11)

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Sales hires often learn how to pitch before they understand how the product works. This disconnects leads to miscommunication, weak demos, and increased reliance on technical teammates.

# Goal:

Goal:Deliver a structured onboarding sprint that ensures sales hires understand both the value and function of the Hidonix product—before they talk to clients.

# Structure:

- Days \(1 
- 3 \rightarrow\) Product vision + Notion walkthrough + Loom demos

- Days \(4 
- 6 \rightarrow\) Shadowing live or recorded demos

- Days \(7 
- 10 \rightarrow\) FAQ simulation training: objections, tech flow, edge cases

- Day  $11 \rightarrow$  Basic product test + clearance for external calls

# Tracking:

- Progress logged in Notion Onboarding Tracker

- Optional Slack alert when clearance is granted

# Benefits:

Sales hires speak credibly from Day 11

Reduces pressure on Product/PMs for presales

Smooths client calls and pitches

# Process 12- HR Responsible for Standard Welcome Pack on Day 1

# Context & Problem:

Inconsistent Day 1 onboarding creates confusion, delays, and poor first impressions for new hires. When accounts, tools, or introductions are missing, it signals disorganization and wastes time.

# Goal:

Ensure that every new employee receives a complete, structured welcome pack on their first day—automated, trackable, and HR- owned.

# What the Welcome Pack Includes:

- Company email and core systems access (Slack, ClickUp, Notion, Factorial)

- Digital internal guide with:

- Tool overview

- Internal values

- Basic policy summary

- Slack welcome message posted in #general

- Optional: CEO Loom intro and "First 5 Days" checklist

# How It Works:

- Triggered by contract activation in Factorial

- Admin and HR are notified via Make

- Workflow tracked in: HR_OnboardingWorkflow_[name].xlsx

# Benefits:

- Smooth and professional Day 1

- Zero gaps in access or visibility

- Sets a high bar for consistency and culture

# Process 13 - 1:1 Welcome Meeting Between HR and New Hire on Day 1

# Context & Problem:

Even with a structured welcome pack, new hires often feel disconnected or unsure without a real- time, human introduction. This can delay engagement, reduce comfort, and miss an opportunity to reinforce Hidonix culture from the start.

# Goal:

Ensure every new hire has a live onboarding introduction with HR on Day 1 to build rapport, align expectations, and offer immediate clarity.

# Introduction Covers:

Company mission and team structure Overview of core tools and communication channels Time off policies, working hours, and flexibility expectations Escalation paths, support options, and feedback norms

# Logistics:

- Duration: 20-30 minutes- Follow-up includes a recap email and (if applicable) the recording link

# Benefits:

- Personal onboarding moment

- Immediate clarity on logistics and culture

- Strengthens early trust and support structure

Location: Linked in Notion + stored in HR onboarding folder

# Process 14 - Internal Toolbox: How We Use Our Tools

# Context & Problem:

Each team member learns how to use tools like ClickUp, Figma, GitHub, or Slack on their own, often inefficiently and inconsistently.

# Goal:

Create a centralized, living toolbox that shows how Hidonix uses each core tool—short, visual, and role- specific.

# How It Works:

1. Create a Notion page called "Hidonix Toolbox", with one section per tool:

![](images/43f14b1975900c23806dba2bbba88be14b5e502d79c5d68b1197be35a00d4b80.jpg)

2. For each tool:

- Add a short Loom tutorial (2-3 min max)- Include:

- Key best practices

- Link to team-specific spaces or templates

- Internal point of contact (e.g., "Ask Gavin for Figma questions")

3. For new hires:

- Slackbot sends a Toolbox link in the onboarding thread- Team Leads can assign first-time checklists

# Tools:

Notion + Loom + Slackbot

# Benefits:

- Faster onboarding

- Standardized tool use

- Less time lost figuring things out

- Clear internal reference for every role

# Process 15- HR: Employee Snapshot for Every New Hire

# Context & Problem:

New hires often feel invisible in their first weeks. Colleagues may not even know their name, skills, or communication style. Every time a new person joins, someone must explain who you are, what you do, how your teams work—it takes time and varies depending on who explains it.

# Goal:

Introduce each new hire quickly and meaningfully—beyond just their job title.

# How It Works:

1. Upon signing their contract, the new team member fills out a Snapshot Form, including: Name, role, location Pronouns Something interesting about you that you would like to share with your new team.

2. The form is sent automatically to HR, who:

Creates a Notion page for the new hire Shares a welcome post in Slack #team- updates

Tools: Notion  $\longrightarrow$  Slack post (automated or manual)

# Benefits:

Benefits:  $\nabla$  Humanizes new hires instantly  $\nabla$  Builds connection from day one  $\nabla$  Makes team collaboration easier from the start

# Process 16-- Message Templates to Reduce Communication Anxiety

# Context & Problem:

Junior employees and new hires often hesitate to ask questions or clarify tasks for fear of sounding "wrong" or being a burden. This slows progress and creates avoidable blockers.

# Goal:

Goal: Provide simple, pre- written message templates that lower the barrier to asking for help, validating work, or seeking clarification—especially in async environments.

# How It Works:

1. A Notion page is created: "Message Templates - Ask with Confidence"Includes

Includes friendly, situational examples like:

"Hey [Name], I'm working on X and wondering if [Y] is correct. Can you confirm?"- "This step wasn't totally clear to me—do you have 2 minutes today to walk through it?"- "I finished this but would love a second pair of eyes before closing it out."

2. The Notion link is:

Included in every onboarding starter kit- Pinned in Slack #onboarding or #help- requests- Optionally added as a reminder in the "First 5 Days" checklist

# Tools:

Tools:Notion + Slack + Onboarding Kit

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Reduces anxiety in communication- Encourages questions and clarifications- Builds psychological safety for junior and introverted team members- Improves async tone and written clarity

# Process 17 - Internal "Tone Guide" for Written Communication

# Context & Problem:

Written communication- - especially in async channels like Slack- - can easily be misread. Without tone cues, even well- meaning messages may come across as blunt, sarcastic, or unclear, leading to friction.

# Goal:

Define and share a clear internal tone guide to help team members communicate assertively, respectfully, and constructively.

# Tone Principles:

- Be direct, but kind- Avoid sarcasm, passive-aggressive tones- Use constructive tagging: "@ here's what I need and why"- Structure messages for clarity:  
- What I'm asking  
- When I need it  
- Context or link to background

# How It Works:

1. A Notion page is created: "Internal Tone Guide for Written communication"- Linked in every onboarding kit- Shared with managers during conflict mediation

# Tools:

Notion + Slack + Optional: Slackbot via Make

# Benefits:

- Reduces misunderstandings in written communication

- Promotes a calm, productive async culture

- Reinforces values of clarity, empathy, and transparency

# Process 18- Automated Employee Onboarding via Factorial

# Context & Problem:

Onboarding processes often rely on people remembering to do things—creating delays, gaps in access, and bad first impressions for new hires.

# Goal:

Automate key onboarding steps across departments as soon as a new hire is added in Factorial.

# How It Works:

1. When HR adds a new hire in Factorial, a webhook triggers Make.

2. Make executes:

Task list in ClickUp for Admin/IT: Email setup Slack invitation ClickUp access GitHub permissions Drive folder creation Creates a personal folder on Google Drive

- Send a welcome message in Slack #general with name, role, and location- notifies HR and IT that onboarding is in progress

# 3. Optional:

Trigger assignment of a Buddy- Invite to first team meeting (calendar)

# Tools:

Factorial  $\rightarrow$  Make  $\rightarrow$  Slack + ClickUp + Google Drive

# Benefits:

- Smooth onboarding- No step forgotten- Cross-team clarity and speed- Positive first-day experience

Section 2: Onboarding Visibility & Early Contribution (Process 19 & 20).

# Purpose

This section ensures two key outcomes during onboarding:

1. Real-time visibility for HR and leadership into onboarding progress across the company2. Structured momentum through an early, meaningful contribution from every new hire within the first 10 days

Together, these elements help standardize onboarding at scale and foster early engagement.

# Part A: Real-Time Onboarding Dashboard

# Why It Matters

Why It MattersHR and the CEO need up- to- date insights into who is onboarding, their status, and where any blockers exist.

# How It Works

When a new hire starts:

Make automatically updates a Notion with: Full name and department. Current onboarding day. Checklist completion percentage Missing tasks or delays Most recent buddy check- in logged

The dashboard can be filtered by:

Department O Buddy assigned O Status: On Track / Delayed / Completed

# Tools Used

Make (automation) Notion (dashboard platform)

# Benefits

Transparent onboarding progress

Early detection of delays or issues

Enables consistent quality across departments

# Part B: Mandatory First Contribution

# Why It Matters

Too often, new hires observe rather than participate. A meaningful first contribution builds confidence, connection, and a sense of ownership.

# How It Works

- Each department's onboarding checklist includes a milestone: "First Contribution", to be completed within the first 10 working days.

Examples of first contributions:

- Example of first contributions:    
- Suggest a UX tweak    
- Review a shared doc and comment    
- Submit a small PR or bug fix    
- Record a short Loom explaining a learning    
- Offer feedback in a team workflow

- The contribution is tracked in ClickUp and marked complete once delivered.

- Optionally, the team or buddy can post a "First Impact" shoutout in Slack to celebrate the new hire's action.

# Tools Used

- ClickUp (task tracking)- Notion (checklist integration)- Slack (team recognition)

# Benefits

Sparks early ownership and confidence

Reinforces a culture of proactivity

Strengthens team visibility and integration

# Process 21-Weekly Lookahead

# Context & Problem:

Weekly alignment meetings should be implemented, and the Meeting should be every Monday at 10.00 AM in US and 5PM on Fridays and every Monday and Friday after the weekly meeting each team leader must fill out this form to state what they have worked on the previous week and what they will work on the upcoming week.

# Goal:

Goal:Replace status calls with a lightweight async written update, shared every Monday to improve planning and team visibility.

# How It Works:

1. Every Monday by 11:00 AM, each team posts in Notion or Slack:

What we'll work on this week. Dependencies Possible blockers

2. Format is short: 3 bullets max

Optionally logged in a recurring Notion doc by week CEO or leads may comment or ask async follow- ups

# Tools:

Slack / Notion  $\rightarrow$  Optional: Slackbot reminder

# Benefits:

Eliminates unproductive meetings

Cross- team visibility

Encourages planning and ownership

# Process 22 - "Monday Brain Dump" (Voluntary, No Pressure)

# Context & Problem:

People have thoughts, feedback, or ideas- - but no structured moment to share them. These often stay stuck in the head or vanish altogether.

# Goal:

Create a low- pressure, async ritual where team members can share anything on their mind at the start of the week- - ideas, doubts, feedback, or reflections.

# How It Works:

Create a Slack channel: #brain- dump or #what- i- think Every Monday morning, a Slackbot reminder posts: Got a thought, idea, concern, or inspiration? Drop it here." Participation is  $100\%$  optional CEO or team leads can read, respond, or log useful input- - no meetings required

# Tools:

Slack + Optional: Slackbot (Make or native reminder)

# Benefits:

Surfaces thoughts from quiet voices

Creates space for reflection

# Process 23 Slack Translator / Hidonix Glossary

# Context & Problem:

New hires and cross- country teams (Italy/US) often get lost in acronyms, internal slang, and references.

# Goal:

Goal: Make a shared, searchable company glossary accessible directly from Slack. Add technical definitions to the glossary that would help non- technical staff understand spatial/mapping concepts- especially for teams involved in robotics, fieldwork, or mapping environments.

# How It Works:

1. Create a Notion page: Hidonix Glossary

Example entries:

English

"PoC" = Proof of Concept- "SSO" = Single Sign- On

Italian

"PoC" = Prova di Concetto- "SSO" = Single Sign- On

2. Integrate with Slack using a /glossario [termine] or /define [word] custom command $\longrightarrow$  Returns the term and its meaning

# Tools:

Tools:Notion + Slack command (via Make or Slack custom integration)

# Benefits:

Faster onboarding

Avoids confusion in written comms

Reduces unnecessary explanations

# Tools Used

- Notion – Profile, index, and growth tracking- ClickUp – Task completion and performance metrics- Factorial – Employee data and updates- Slack – Notifications, celebrations, alerts- Make – Automation engine for updates and triggers

# Process (28-30)- Professional Development Request & Certification System

Context & Problem: Employees are often eager to upskill or attend professional events but lack a structured way to request support. Without a clear process, HR may miss key learning opportunities and outcomes may go untracked reducing their impact on growth or reviews.

Goal: Enable employee growth through a transparent, trackable process for requesting training, logging certifications, and encouraging ongoing learning—across all departments.

# Part 1: Requesting Learning Opportunities

Any employee may request training or event participation by submitting a proposal that includes:

Title of course/event

Estimated cost

Relevance to their role, project, or skill goals

# Approval Workflow:

- Reviewed by HR + Program Manager + CEO

If approved:

Full or partial cost is covered

Post- event feedback required

Certification (if applicable) archived

Proposal form: FormazioneRequest_[name].pdf

Log: TrainingApproved.xlsx

# Part 2: Certification Logging & Review Integration

To ensure skills are visible and used during performance tracking:

Any certified course must be: Added to the employee's Factorial profile. o Logged in the Employee_SkillMatrix.xlsx o Referenced during quarterly or semi- annual reviews

Visibility: HR + PMs + CEO (as needed)

# Part 3: Proactive Reminders to All Teams

To increase awareness and access: In January and July, HR sends a Slack + email reminder:

"Submit your professional development or course requests!"

Includes deadline, link to proposal form, and link to Notion page

Reminder automation: Slackbot + Email + Notion references

# Benefits:

- Empowers team-wide learning culture- Links skill development to performance growth- Builds visibility of role evolution and internal talent depth- Encourages participation from non-technical and overlooked roles

# Process 31- Annual Vacation and Time-Off Planning

# Context & Problem:

Uncoordinated vacation scheduling creates overlapping absences that disrupt operations and delay project delivery.

# Cool:

Ensure a balanced distribution of absences across the year through a planning framework.

# Process:

- By the end of Q1 each year, every employee must submit their planned vacation dates.

- HR and team lead jointly review and approve the proposed absences.

- Any changes to approved plans require a minimum of 15 days' notice.

# Benefits:

- Prevents overlapping time-off

- Supports fair and transparent leave scheduling

- Maintains operational continuity across teams

# Process 32- Managing Unexpected Absences

# Context & Problem:

Unplanned absences can disrupt workflows, delay progress, and create coverage gaps—especially in tightly coordinated teams.

# Goal:

Provide a fast and standardized response protocol to ensure operational continuity when unexpected absences occur.

# Process:

- The employee must notify both HR and their team via Slack by 09:15 on the same day. If the absence is due to illness or medical reasons, a doctor's note must be submitted within 24 hours. HR logs the absence in the centralized tracker and immediately informs the team lead to arrange temporary coverage or task reallocation.

# Process 33- HR Protocol for In-Office Health Emergencies

# Context & Problem:

Illness or injuries that occur in the workplace must be handled with preparedness and trained response. Improvisation can lead to further risk, liability, or delayed care.

# Goal:

Goal:Ensure that every office location is equipped and ready to manage basic health emergencies safely and efficiently.

# Process:

Each physical office must maintain:

Process:Each physical office must maintain:- A verified and stocked first- aid kit (checked monthly by Admin or HR)- At least one designated, trained first responder available during core hours- A visible emergency contact list posted in a common area (including building emergency numbers and internal contacts)

# Benefits:

Ensures preparedness for unexpected health events

Reduces liability and panic during emergencies

Reinforces workplace safety culture

Process (34 & 35) - Culture & Feedback Listening System (Quarterly + Biannual)

# Context & Problem:

Leadership cannot address what it cannot see. Without structured listening mechanisms, cultural or motivational issues go unnoticed, leading to disengagement or attrition.

# Goal:

Goal:Ensure consistent, meaningful insights into employee wellbeing, motivation, communication, and growth expectations.

# How It Works:

Once per quarter, HR runs an anonymous survey to capture the cultural pulse of the organization. The survey includes 5 closed questions and 1 open question. Results are reviewed only by HR and the CEO and logged in HR Folder on Notion.

Twice per year, HR schedules a private 1- on- 1 session with each employee to allow space for open, non- managerial dialogue. Topics may include workload, clarity, communication, or career growth. A summary is recorded only if mutually agreed upon.

# Benefits:

Enables early detection of cultural or engagement issues

Builds trust between HR and employees

Strengthens data- driven leadership visibility

# Process 36- Annual Product Knowledge Check for All Employees

# Context & Problem:

Even experienced team members can lose touch with evolving product architecture and new features—creating blind spots and internal misalignment.

# Goal:

Ensure that every employee—technical or not—maintains updated product knowledge each year.

# How It Works:

- Once annually, each employee completes:    
- A short case-based quiz

An update review on:

New modules Architecture changes

Latest integrations

Applies to all roles: developers, ops, admin, PMs, senior staff

Results are:

Logged in Factorial

Shared with HR and the CEO

# Benefits:

Maintains full- org alignment

Prevents silos between technical and non- technical teams

Reinforces internal product literacy and agility

# Tools:

Tools:- Google Forms or Typeform + Factorial logging + Optional Notion link for materials

# Process 37- Product Learning Path by Department Role

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:A generic product training doesn't serve the nuanced needs of each department. Engineers, marketers, designers, and PMs need different lenses on the same product to truly internalize how it works and how their work supports it.

# Goal:

Goal:Deliver tailored product learning experiences by role—ensuring relevance, engagement, and retention across functions.

# How It Works:

Each department gets a dedicated learning path within Notion:

Dev: API references, module behavior, edge case architecture- UX: User flows, navigation logic, system feedback-  $①$  PM: Component relationships, roadmap structure, release logic- Sales/Marketing: Customer value stories, key use cases, objections- handling

# Additional Notes:

Additional Notes:- Learning paths are self- paced but expected within onboarding or learning month timelines- No gamification—this is a focused learning experience, not a leaderboard- Completion requires a final quiz or submission to verify understanding

# Benefits:

Improves product fluency by function

Enables better decisions, designs, and pitches

Deepens product- quality culture across departments

Owner: Product Team (with HR support for onboarding integration)

Logged in: Notion - Learning Paths Database

# Process 38- Mandatory Product Training for Strategic Roles

# Context & Problem:

PMS, Devs, and client- facing leads need complete product fluency to make high- impact decisions and represent Hidonix effectively. Gaps in understanding can compromise delivery, strategy, and client trust.

# Rule:

Strategic roles must complete all assigned product learning modules- - no exceptions.

# Applies to:

$\bullet$  PMs QA Devs UX Senior Sales

# Completion Includes:

All modules completed

Final test (passing required)

Optional 1:1 with CTO or CEO to discuss deeper questions or gaps

# Tracking:

Logged in Factorial + HR's performance visibility dashboard.

# Benefits:

Promotes depth of knowledge

Supports role promotions and readiness

Improves client delivery and decision quality

# Process 39- Personal Product Knowledge Tracker Per Employee

# Context & Problem:

Product learning happens across many channels—but without centralized tracking, managers can't act on gaps, and development becomes invisible.

# Goal:

Track and surface each employee's learning status so HR, leads, and the CEO can support, recognize, or redirect learning.

# Tracker Includes:

- Modules completed- Test scores- Last update date- Learning gaps identified- Visual dashboard—shared with HR, team leads, CEO- Used in quarterly reviews and promotion planning

# Benefits:

Informed people management

Ongoing growth conversations

Supports promotions and internal mobility

Process 40 - Role- Product Impact Map: "How Your Work Affects Our Products" Objective:

Help each team member- - especially non- product roles- - understand how their work connects to what Hidonix builds and delivers.

# What to do:

Create a Notion page titled "How My Role Impacts Our Product" Structure it as follows: o Short introduction on the purpose o A visual map (even a simple table/flow) showing each department's impact on the product o One- line explanation per role or team, based on the detailed breakdown we've drafted

Add it to the onboarding checklist for new hires

Optionally reference it in Slack welcome threads or buddy sessions

This is a one- time setup, with minor updates over time. It's meant to reinforce cross- team purpose and product awareness from day one.

# Process 41- Continuous Training Program on Process Improvement Principles

# Context & Problem:

Improvement knowledge (PDCA, Lean, Six Sigma) is fragmented and informal across teams.

Goal: Create a structured training cycle for all staff on process optimization.

# Components:

Monthly workshops (PDCA, Lean, Six Sigma)

Study materials: practical guides, case studies

Internal certifications  $\longrightarrow$  bronze/silver/gold level

Calendar: Continuous_Improvement_Training_Schedule.xlsx

Tracking: Tracked in employee growth file

# Benefits:

Builds internal fluency in process excellence

Reduces variability in how teams approach optimization

Encourages standardization of improvement methods

Supports professional growth through certified learning paths

Process 42– Meeting Decision Tracker, to make sure key decisions from our meetings don't get lost in transcripts or Slack threads.Here's

Here's how we'll do it:

# What's the goal?

Create a single, clean Notion page where we track only major decisions — things that affect budget, scope, timeline, or company- wide processes.This

This avoids confusion later and helps everyone stay aligned.

How it works: During or right after a meeting, if a clear decision is made (e.g. "We'll proceed with X", "Let's drop Y", "This will be the new policy"), we are just:

# Write it in the Notion Decision Log

Write it in the Notion Decision Log- Tag it as #decision- (Optional) Link it to a ClickUp task if relevant. Once a day or week, Sakhi or Tina shares a brief Slack summary of any new logged decisions, so the team stays informed without extra meetings.

# Tools:

Notion  $\longrightarrow$  for the log Slack  $\longrightarrow$  for the digest ClickUp links if the decision relates to a task)

# Process 43- Personal Growth Tracker for Every Employee

# Context & Problem:

Without structured visibility into professional goals and learning progress, employees may feel directionless, and HR cannot support role development or internal mobility effectively.

# Goal:

Maintain a centralized, shared record that captures each employee's long- term growth path, achievements, and aspirations—visible to HR, their manager, and the CEO.

# Structure:

Each employee's Personal Growth Tracker in Notion includes:

- 6–12-month professional development goals- Completed trainings and certifications- Self-review and team lead performance scores- Stated career aspirations or desired role evolution

Tracker Location: Notion – PersonalGrowth_[Name]

Access: HR, direct team lead, CEO

# Benefits:

- Ensures aligned growth conversations

- Supports promotions and mobility

- Encourages reflection and ownership over development

# Process 44 - Productivity Monitoring Based on Onsite Presence

# Context & Problem

Assumptions about productivity tied to remote vs. in- office presence often lack data, leading to inaccurate conclusions or unfair planning decisions.

# Goal:

Goal:Monitor and analyze whether consistent onsite presence correlates with measurable output—without creating punitive systems.

# How It Works

How It Works- HR collects monthly data on each team's productivity and in- office attendance- Data includes task completion rates, collaboration signals, and presence logs- A quarterly report is prepared and reviewed with team leads to assess patterns, concerns, or adjustments

# Benefits

Enables data- based decisions around flexibility and structure

Supports team- level calibration and leadership conversations

Encourages balance between autonomy and performance visibility

# Process 45 - In-Depth Product Questions for Sales & Marketing (Quarterly)

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Sales and marketing team members often know surface- level features—but falter when clients raise nuanced or technical scenarios. This erodes credibility and slows deal cycles.

# Goal:

Goal:Improve real- world fluency through short, quarterly challenges focused on actual use cases and product behavior—without stress or grading.

# How It Works:

HR or PM sends 3- 5 case- based product questions quarterly

Participants reply via: Loom (verbal response), or

Written form

Example prompts:

What's the fallback if BLE is weak in a large venue?

What changed from Indoor Nav v1.4 to v2.0—and why?

How do we handle real- time updates in CMS under poor network?

# Benefits:

Surfaces team- wide blind spots

Feeds into documentation improvement

Builds client- facing confidence and readiness

# Process 46 - Monthly "Product Deep Dive" Learning Track (Voluntary + Rewarded)

# Context & Problem:

Product champions are built through initiative, not just compliance.

# Goal:

Offer optional monthly product- learning deep dives with recognition incentives.

# Structure:

Structure:- 1 product/module per month- Content:- Loom- Slide deck- Test- Reward: Internal badge, slack leaderboard visibility and bonus points for internal visibility

# Benefits:

- Encourages curiosity- Recognizes internal learners- Promotes product culture

# Process 47- In-House Continuous Training Program

# Context & Problem:

Without internal development opportunities, teams may stagnate or rely solely on external training.

# Goal:

Host monthly internal training sessions to grow both soft and technical skills across the organization.

# Process:

- HR organizes one internal workshop per month- Employees may suggest topics through a shared Notion form or Slack thread- Attendance is required for a minimum of 8 sessions per year per employee

Schedule: InHouseTrainingSchedule.xlsx

# Benefits:

- Builds internal capabilities

- Encourages peer learning

- Supports career progression and role evolution

# Process 48 & 49 - Post-Training Mentorship & Feedback Loop

# Context & Problem:

New hires benefit most when internal training is reinforced with human support and feedback is captured to improve future sessions. Without mentorship, learning may not stick. Without feedback, sessions don't evolve.

# Goal:

Support learning continuity by assigning mentors to new hires and collecting structured feedback to refine internal development programs.

# How It Works:

Every new hire is assigned a peer mentor for the first 90 days

Mentor helps clarify training content, tools, and team culture

Encourages informal integration and continuous check- ins

After each internal training session:

Attendees complete a short feedback form

HR reviews and synthesizes insights to improve future sessions

# Benefits:

Reinforces training with practical support

Boosts integration, confidence, and cultural alignment

Enables continuous learning improvement

Process 50- Continuous Training on Process Improvement Methodologies

Goal: Institutionalize a learning system for operational excellence.

# Actions:

Monthly workshops (PDCA, Lean, Six Sigma) Access to practical guides and case studies Internal certification program

# Process 51 - Historical Profile for Strategic Reviews and Investors

# Context & Problem:

When preparing for investor conversations, board updates, or strategic partner reviews, it's difficult to show the evolution and maturity of your team in a clear, credible format.

# Goal:

Create a PDF- exportable historical profile for each employee to showcase growth, depth, and strategic value over time.

# What It Includes:

Timeline of roles and responsibilities Key performance metrics Lead  $^+$  CEO summary quotes Milestones, promotions, and level progression

Shows maturity and talent evolution to investors

Strengthens internal planning and decision- making

# Section 4: Semi-Annual Performance Review via Factorial (Process 52)

# Context & Problem

In fast- paced environments, performance feedback often becomes inconsistent or skipped altogether. This leads to unclear expectations, missed growth opportunities, and a lack of documented development for employees and leadership.

# Goal

Establish a structured, fair, and growth- focused review cycle every six months. Combine digital evaluations with human- centered 1:1 conversation involving the employee, manager, HR, and in some cases, the CEO.

# How It Works

# 1. Cycle Trigger (Every 6 Months)

- Factorial automatically launches a new performance review cycle for all employees.

# 2. Two-Part Review Process

A. Digital Review Submission (via Factorial):

Completed by both the employee and their direct manager, including:

- Role-specific reflection and evaluation- Assessment of communication, ownership, delivery, and collaboration- Optional peer feedback or self-assessment- Space for growth areas, blockers, and aspirations

# B. 1:1 Performance Conversation:

Attendees: Employee  $^+$  Manager  $^+$  HR (CEO may join for strategic roles or key contributors) Topics include:

Strengths and accomplishments Areas for development Alignment with team and company goals. Future aspirations and concerns

# Documentation & Tracking

HR writes a summary of the conversation, capturing:

Key discussion points Growth goals or adjustments agreed upon. Actionable outcomes

Stored in a private Google Drive folder, linked to the employee's Factorial profile Shared with the employee for acknowledgment and digital signature

# Optional Add-On: Slack Digest

At the end of each cycle, HR may share an anonymized Slack summary to highlight:

- Common themes across reviews- Systemic blockers- Emerging cultural insights

# Tools Used

- Factorial (review workflows, digital signatures)- Google Drive (review archive)

- Slack + Make (digest automation, optional)

# Benefits

Benefits- Creates a culture of structured feedback and fairness- Strengthens alignment and clarity between employees and managers- Tracks development trends over time- Enables formal recognition and transparent accountability- Builds trust and growth through consistent check- ins

# Process 53 - Quarterly "Real Client Case Simulation" Objective:

Provide lightweight, quarterly practice exercises that help team members reflect on real- world product or client scenarios- - no grading, just learning.

# What to do:

Once per quarter, HR will share a client case (real or synthetic) via Notion and Slack Each employee submits a short- written response based on their role o e.g., Devs explain potential causes, Sales frames the pitch, UX suggests design fixes Submissions are reviewed jointly by.  $\mathsf{HR} + \mathsf{PM}$  to identify knowledge gaps and training needs. Optionally, insights can feed into onboarding content or product improvements We'll start simple, using Notion to collect responses and Slack for notifications. Automation via Make can be added later.

# Process 54- Product Knowledge Score Included in Performance Reviews

# Context & Problem

While employees may complete product learning requirements, there's no formal consequence or weight assigned to that knowledge in performance evaluation. This weakens accountability and product alignment.

# Goal

Incorporate product knowledge as a formal metric within the performance review score—ensuring technical fluency is consistently valued.

# How It Works

- The annual product quiz becomes a scored component of each employee's semi-annual performance review.- If the quiz score is  $\geq 80\%$ :    
-  $\checkmark$  Counted as a positive signal in the review summary.- If the score is  $\checkmark 80\%$     
-  $\circ$  Triggers a mandatory booster module (assigned via Notion or LMS).

The product score is:

- The product score is:    
-  $\circ$  Logged in Factorial    
-  $\circ$  Displayed in the employee's review summary (private)    
-  $\circ$  Visible in HR and CEO dashboards for tracking and planning

# Benefits

Aligns product learning with career progression

Makes knowledge gaps visible and coachable

Reinforces the cultural value of product fluency

# Section 5: Ongoing Performance & Review Cycles

Tools and rituals that help leadership understand performance, build trust, and support growth—without micromanagement or drama. Designed to balance accountability with psychological safety.

# Process 55 - Reliability Tracker (Silent KPI)

# Context & Problem:

You don't track who consistently does what they say they'll do. Add a guideline emphasizing that task performance metrics should account for both the complexity and quality of work—not just the number of tasks completed. Teams should avoid inflating task counts by artificially breaking down work into smaller, low- value segments.

# Goal:

Implement a quiet but powerful reliability score, based on real task behavior.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- Make monitors ClickUp or Asana task activity and tracks:- % of tasks completed on time- % completed without reminder- Average delay (if any)- Scores are aggregated and private- Only visible to CEO and HR

# Benefits:

Adds trust- based KPI

Helps in reviews without drama

Supports "dependability" as a core trait

# Process 56- Anonymous Peer Review (CEO-Filtered)

# Context & Problem:

Important interpersonal issues stay hidden unless reported directly- - and often never are.

# Goal:

Goal:Create a safe, anonymous, filtered review cycle where people can speak honestly.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- Every 6 months, team members review 2- 3 peers- Focus areas:  - Trustworthiness  - Communication  - Teamwork- Reviewer names are anonymous- Results are seen only by CEO and HR, summarized per person or theme

# Tools:

Tools:Google Form or Factorial review cycle

# Benefits:

Reveals what doesn't surface in meetings

Creates honest, constructive leadership input

# (Process 57-59) Performance Visibility System

A modular system that combines individual performance tracking, monthly trend reporting, and recurring peer/lead feedback—designed to surface patterns early and support fair, data- informed reviews.

# Process 57 - Ongoing Performance Profile

# Context & Problem:

There's no single place that captures a person's growth, goals, and contribution history over time.

# Goal:

Maintain a live performance profile for each employee, used for reviews, promotion planning, or investor reporting.

# What's Included:

- Quarterly goals- Completed key tasks- Cross-team contributions- Peer and manager feedback- History of promotions, delays, leadership notes- Access:

CEO, HR, Team Leads only

Profile lives in Notion or Factorial, exportable as needed

# Benefits:

Strategic overview of growth and impact

Useful in board meetings and HR decisions

Stronger alignment on individual evolution

# Process 58 - Monthly Auto-Generated Performance Report

# Context & Problem:

Managers and the CEO don't receive regular summaries of performance signals unless requested manually. For R&D and robotics projects: Include a clause stating that any significant roadmap shifts, or scope changes must prompt a recalibration of performance expectations. This ensures that evaluation metrics remain fair and contextually accurate as project conditions evolve.

# Goal:

Create a monthly report per employee, delivered automatically and consistently.

# What's Included:

What's Included:- % of tasks completed- Average completion time- Slack engagement or meeting participation (MeetGeek)- Peer or internal feedback (anonymous, if relevant)- Optional note from HR

# Workflow:

Make compiles the report and stores it in Notion or Factorial, and sends it to CEO + lead team

# Benefits:

Light but insightful

Trend tracking over time

Reduces last- minute feedback stress before reviews

# Process 59- "3+1" Quarterly Feedback Cycle

# Context & Problem:

Quarterly reviews often rely only on manager input, or they happen reactively, without structure.

# Goal:

Implement a balanced review structure with peer and lead feedback, collected and archived regularly.

# How It Works:

1. Every employee receives:

- 3 peer feedback (performance, collaboration, clarity)- 1 feedback summary from the leadership team

2. Everything is:

- Collected via Slack form or Factorial- Archived in the employee's performance profile- Used in 1:1s and career reviews

# Tools:

Factorial + Slack + Notion + Make

# Benefits:

Holistic feedback

Light, recurring rhythm

Strengthens peer recognition culture

# Process 60 - Unified Performance Index per Role

# Context & Problem:

Comparing people in the same role (Dev, Sales, PM) is difficult without a shared performance structure. Reviews become subjective and hard to benchmark.

# Goal:

Define a clear Performance Index for each role, based on consistent, role- relevant metrics.

# How It Works:

Each role (e.g., Developer, Sales, PM, UX) has a defined index combining:

Core objectives Role- specific KPIs (e.g., bug fix rate, client approval score, delivery punctuality) Collaboration & communication feedback Task precision and completeness rate

Scores are updated monthly and shared with HR + CEO as a lightweight scorecard.

# Tools:

Tools:Make+ Notion DB + ClickUp/Factorial integration

# Benefits:

Fair, data- based comparison

Supports promotions and rewards

Improves internal transparency

# Section 6: Internal Operations & Knowledge Governance

A set of lightweight but critical processes that ensure the integrity, continuity, and stewardship of company knowledge. These workflows support role transitions, maintain cross- team clarity, and protect long- term access to essential documents and systems.

# Process 61- Document Ownership Reassignment Workflow

# Context & Problem:

When someone changes roles or leaves, their files and documents often lose a clear owner. This creates gaps in accountability, broken links, and operational blind spots.

# Goal:

Reassign document ownership proactively whenever there's a role transition to ensure continuity and clarity.

# How It Works:

- When HR triggers an offboarding:    
- Make automatically creates a task titled "Reassign Document Ownership"    
- Admin or Program Manager:

- Reviews files owned by the departing employee

- Assigns a new responsible owner per file or folder

- Logs all changes in the Notion doc or NAS changelog

# Tools:

Make + Notion + Internal NAS or Drive system

# Benefits:

- Prevents abandoned documents

- Enables smoother team transitions

- Maintains institutional memory and data continuity

Owner: HR/ People Ops

Collaborators: Admin or Program Manager

Logged in: Notion or company changelog system

- Process 62 – "Document Sharing Rules" Kit for Employees

# Context & Problem:

Team members often don't know what they can or cannot share externally leading to data leaks or risky oversharing.

# Goal:

Provide a centralized internal playbook with sharing rules, approved channels, and explicit restrictions.

# How It Works:

- A Notion page is created: "Document Sharing Rules", which outlines:

- What documents are allowed to be shared externally- What documents must never be shared (e.g., internal roadmap, employee data)- Approved methods: encrypted email, client portal, NAS links only

# Every new employee:

- Reads and acknowledges the rules during onboarding- Retakes a short quiz annually to confirm understanding

# Tools:

- Notion + HR checklist (Factorial) + Slack (reminder)

# Benefits:

- Clear, enforced compliance

- Educated, risk-aware teams

- Reduced legal and operational exposure

- Owner: Legal + HR (shared)

- Logged in: Notion, Factorial

- Reminder cycle: Annual via Slackbot

# Process 63 - Do Not Use Personal Tools for Company Work

# Context & Problem:

Using personal tools (e.g., email, Drive, chat apps) for company work creates fragmentation, security risks, and compliance gaps. It makes collaboration harder and puts sensitive data outside of managed systems.

# Requirement:

All work must take place within company- approved platforms- - tools that are access- controlled, documented, and covered by internal policies.

# Strictly Forbidden:

- Personal Gmail or aliases- Personal Google Drive or Dropbox- WhatsApp, Trello, or other non-corporate accounts

# Approved Tools Must Be:

- Covered by internal access policies- Auditable and recoverable by IT/Admin

# Why This Matters:

- Prevents data leakage and confusion- Supports legal and operational compliance- Ensures all work is visible, secure, and recoverable

# Process 64 - BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy

# Context & Problem:

Using personal devices for company work can introduce legal, operational, and data security risks when unmanaged.

# Goal:

Allow limited use of personal devices while ensuring full compliance with Hidonix security and accountability standards.

# Rules:

Rules:- A signed BYOD policy is required before using any personal laptop, phone, or tablet for work.- All approved personal devices must be logged in the BYOD_InventoryRegister.csv.- Only encrypted devices may be used for work purposes.- Reimbursement may be requested based on usage level and must be pre- approved.- Any device used must comply with internal data handling and access protocols.

# Benefits:

Prevents untracked or risky device use

Maintains data integrity and audit readiness

Supports flexibility within compliance

# Process 65 - Confidentiality Policy for Sensitive HR Topics

# Context & Problem:

Leaks or casual mentions of HR matters—such as personal conflicts, medical issues, or disciplinary actions—undermine trust, damage morale, and violate professional standards.

# Goal:

Goal:Protect the privacy of all HR- related matters through a strict, enforceable confidentiality policy, grounded in the principle of "need- to- know only."

# Rules:

Rules:- HR matters may only be discussed within HR and the CEO unless explicit consent is given.- Team leads are strictly prohibited from forwarding or paraphrasing HR conversations.- Any breach of confidentiality is immediately reported to the CEO for review and potential disciplinary action.

File: (Signed at onboarding)

# Process 66 - Employees Must Protect Confidential Company Data

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Even small missteps—like forwarding a file to a personal inbox—can expose sensitive company or client data, risking compliance violations or reputational damage.

# Obligation:

Obligation:Every employee is responsible for safeguarding confidential data and upholding all internal and external data protection standards.

# Confidentiality Rules:

Confidentiality Rules:- Do not forward files using unapproved platforms- Do not save work files on personal devices without written permission- Always follow NDA, data classification, and internal privacy guidelines- Report any suspected breach immediately to HR or Legal

# Why This Matters:

![](images/e5cbc58336386492ac2400057fe45bb0e10e11357ddcf5325999800bc8bb0165.jpg)

Protects our intellectual property and client trust

Ensures legal and regulatory compliance

Builds a culture of accountability and information security

# Section 7: Team Norms for Distributed Work

Practices that support healthy, accountable, and smooth collaboration across time zones and roles.

As a distributed, async- friendly company, Hidonix operates with meetings and high trust. To make this model sustainable, we've established a set of team norms around communication, availability, and etiquette. These are not tied to performance reviews directly, but they shape our everyday workflows and help avoid friction, ambiguity, and avoidable delays.

These norms apply to everyone- - from new hires to leads- - and are designed to balance flexibility with responsibility.

# Process 67 & 68 - Slack Must Remain Active During Working Hours

# Context & Problem:

Slack is the heartbeat of real- time coordination. If a team member is offline or unreachable, it delays others and blocks work- - especially in distributed teams. An exception will be added for the R&D department because internet access may be unavailable (e.g. testing on drone or robot networks). These exceptions will be reported but not penalized.

# Requirement:

Each employee must keep Slack open, online, and monitored throughout their agreed working hours.

# What's Expected:

What's Expected:- Be logged into Slack and visibly online- Check Slack regularly—don't leave it minimized or muted for hours- Do not work "offline" without letting your lead know

# Valid Exceptions:

Sick leave or emergencies PTO or approved time off Heads- down deep work sessions (must be reflected in your Slack status)

# Monitoring:

Make or Slack analytics may track:

Presence status Ping response times Extended inactivity

# Why This Matters:

Keeps workflows smooth

Avoids bottlenecks

Ensures transparency in distributed teams

"Being online isn't just about tools—it's about being reachable by your team."

# Process 69 - All Core Work Tools Must Be Active and Accessible

# Context & Problem:

When team members work outside official tools or don't stay logged in, important updates go undocumented, communication breaks down, and work becomes invisible.

# Requirement:

During working hours, employees must be active and reachable on all Hidonix- approved work platforms.

# Required Tools:

- Slack  $\rightarrow$  Communication- ClickUp or Asana  $\rightarrow$  Task tracking- Notion  $\rightarrow$  Docs and shared knowledge- Gmail  $\rightarrow$  Email comms- MeetGeek  $\rightarrow$  Meeting notes and recordings

# Each employee must:

- Keep these tools open throughout the day- Check them regularly (don't "ghost" platforms)- Use only company-authorized accounts and logins

# Why This Matters:

- Prevents dropped handoffs

- Keeps the team aligned and in sync

- Ensures visibility for cross-functional work

# $\circleddash$  (Process 70-72) - Visibility & Presence Rules for Distributed Teams

# Context & Problem:

In distributed teams, work stalls when others don't know your status, hours, or where your tasks live. Miscommunication, missed handoffs, and data loss stem from unclear norms.

# Goal:

Ensure accurate visibility into team members' availability, schedules, and work locations—so collaboration flows without disruption.

# Part 1: Keep Your Slack Status Accurate

Your Slack status should always reflect your real situation:

- Active: You're online and available- On break / In a meeting: Use emoji or status message- Out of office: Set status, update calendar, notify lead

When in doubt—over- communicate. Even a quick emoji update prevents hours of confusion.

# Part 2: Make Working Hours Visible

Respect and share your time boundaries:

- Start your day on time- Notify your lead or #admin channel if late, sick, or stepping out- Log PTO or extended breaks in your shared calendar- Shifted hours? Mention them in Slack for clarity

This helps hybrid teams and cross- timezone colleagues plan better.

# Part 3: Keep Work in Approved Tools

No private islands. All work must live in company- authorized platforms:

- Tasks: ClickUp or Asana- Docs: Notion or company NAS- Communication: Slack or company Gmail

- Prohibited: Personal Gmail, WhatsApp, Trello, or unshared Google Docs

# Why This Matters:

- Prevents misunderstandings

- Keeps everyone aligned and reachable

- Avoids data loss and ensures transparency

- Reinforces a healthy, async-ready culture

- Process 73 – Limited Hybrid Policy: In-Office Work as the Hidonix Standard

# Context & Problem:

Without a clear stance on hybrid work, teams become inconsistent, lose cohesion, and onboarding becomes more complex.

# Goal:

Reaffirm on- site work as the company default, with structured exceptions.

# Rule:

- Office work = default

- Remote work only allowed for:

- Family/emergency health situations

High- focus tasks (pre- approved by PM or CEO)

Request submitted via Slack  $^+$  email  $\geq 48h$  before

HR tracks approvals

# Benefits:

Team alignment and routine

Clarity for new hires and leads

Reduced friction in distributed workflows

# Process (74 -76) - Time & Presence Coordination Policy

# Context & Problem:

When work hours, in- office presence, and delay notifications are inconsistent, it disrupts collaboration, creates tension, and undermines accountability in distributed teams.

# Goal:

Set clear, flexible- but- structured expectations around time management and physical presence.

# Rules:

Core hours: 09:30- 17:00 (mandatory overlap for all roles) Entry window: 08:30- 09:30 Exit window: 17:00- 18:30 Permanent schedule changes require HR  $^+$  CEO approval

# Presence Tracking:

Presence Tracking:- Use /checkin and /checkout in Slack, or- NFC badge or QR scan system (location- specific)- Admin/HR can cross- check logs as needed

# Delays or Absences:

Delays or Absences:- Must notify by 09:15 at the latest- Channel: #presence on Slack- Also, DM your team lead or PM- Repeated no- shows or late notices  $\rightarrow$  escalated to HR + CEO

Catania Office should install a badge- based door access system to support flexible hours, since not all the team members have access to keys at the moment.

Managed via: Google Calendar + Factorial attendance + Absence_Report_[month].xlsx

# Benefits:

Supports collaborative rhythm

Allows flexibility without chaos

Reinforces trust and professional discipline

# Process 77 - Weekly Scheduled "Deep Work" Time Slots Per Team

# Context & Problem:

Interruptions—whether in open- plan offices or from Slack pings—disrupt focus and push team members to request remote time just to concentrate.

# Goal:

Goal:Dedicate protected deep work slots each week for focused, uninterrupted execution across all teams.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- Each team sets one 2- hour block weekly for deep work- No calls, meetings, or Slack messages allowed during this time- Slack status auto updated to "Do Not Disturb"- Managers ensure this time is honored and consistent- Managed via: Google Calendar + Slack status automation

# Benefits:

Boosts concentration and quality

Encourages respect for async productivity

Reduces unnecessary context- switching

# Process 78 - In-Office Time = Opportunity for Team Learning & Culture

# Context & Problem:

Mandatory in- office days can feel rigid or pointless unless they're tied to growth and informal connection.

# Goal:

Transform on- site presence into high- value learning and cultural touchpoints that enrich the team experience.

# Recurring Events:

Team retrospectives

Live product demos

Coffee briefs / cross- team meetups

HR or Marketing mini events

Events listed and managed in Notion  $\rightarrow$  Auto- invites via Slack

# Benefits:

Increases in- person value

Strengthens cross- team connection

Builds organic learning culture

Process (79 & 80) - Responsiveness Standards: Gmail, Slack & Tool Comments

# Context & Problem:

When messages go unanswered—whether in Gmail, Slack, or ClickUp—work stalls, deadlines slip, and client trust erodes. Even brief delays can block entire workflows.

# Goal:

Create a unified standard for timely, respectful communication across all key platforms.

# Part 1: Company Gmail Must Be Checked Daily

All work email (especially from clients, legal, ops) must be reviewed every day If you can't reply fully, send a quick acknowledgment ("Noted, will reply tomorrow") Resolve threads by marking them "Done" or archiving No email should sit unread for more than 24 hours

# Part 2: Slack & Comments Must Be Answered Promptly

Reply to messages during working hours within 30 minutes max

Applies to:

Slack DMs or channel messages- Notion and ClickUp comments- @mentions in shared docs

If you're busy:

Set a Slack status ("Heads down", "In meeting", etc.)- Drop a quick response: "Got it—will reply after X"- Use Slack's reminder feature to avoid forgetting

# Why This Matters:

Unblocks teammates and keeps work flowing

Shows professionalism to clients and stakeholders

Reinforces async- friendly, transparent communication

# Process 81 - You Must Participate in Your Team's Operational Channel

# Context & Problem:

People "lurk" in team channels without contributing—making teamwork slower and less cohesive.

# Requirement:

You must be active in your team's operational channel (e.g., #team- dev, #team- qa, etc.)

# Expected Participation:

Expected Participation:- Post weekly updates- React to team announcements- Raise issues or blockers- Join rituals (e.g., Friday recap, async handoff)

Participation is monitored via Slack analytics or Make- based tagging.

# Why This Matters:

Makes contribution visible Encourages team- wide awareness Builds trust across roles

# Feedback Is Mandatory When Requested

# Context & Problem:

Team rituals like retrospectives, onboarding reviews, or surveys rely on active participation. When people stay silent, critical insights are lost—and the team misses chances to improve.

# Obligation:

When feedback is requested by your team, HR, or leadership—you are expected to respond.

# How To Participate:

- Share at least one thoughtful comment in retrospectives- Complete feedback forms (e.g., onboarding, reviews)

-  $\mathcal{O}$  Speak up respectfully when something isn't working

# Why This Matters:

- Fuels continuous improvement

- Gives leaders real signals—not assumptions

- Ensures everyone's voice counts

# Process 82 - Off-Hours Non-Availability Policy

# Context & Problem:

Without a clear boundary around work hours, employees may feel subtle pressure to respond during evenings, weekends, or while on PTO—leading to burnout and blurred personal time.

# Goal:

Protect personal time by formalizing expectations for communication and availability outside of working hours.

# Rule:

- No response is required or expected:    
- After 18:30 on weekdays    
- On weekends or during approved PTO

- Slack and other tools are used asynchronously after hours (delayed message scheduling encouraged)

# Process 83 - Mental Load Monitoring Integrated into Task Assignment

# Context & Problem

Excellent performance and tracking systems exist, but there is no lightweight signal to flag burnout risk or invisible overload.

# Goal

Introduce a recurring, non- intrusive mental load check that maps subjective strain to task volume.

# How It Works

- Slack pulse check every Friday:  $\checkmark$  Normal /  $\checkmark$  Overloaded- Makw alerts sent to CEO/PM if "Overloaded" is selected 2+ weeks- Cross-referenced in ClickUp with task volume and blockers- Pulse Log: MentalLoad_Weekly.csv- Escalation built into support flow

# Benefits

- Prevents silent burnout

- Encourages early support-seeking

- Links perceived strain with operational load

# Process 84 - All Meetings Must Be Attended Punctually

# Context & Problem:

Tardiness—especially in distributed or fast- paced environments—causes ripple effects: lost time, rushed agendas, and frustrated teammates. When people show up late or don't show up at all, it undermines the effort others put in.

# Obligation:

If you are expected in a meeting, you must attend—and arrive on time.

# What's Expected:

- Be present at the scheduled start time

- Let the organizer or your lead know if you can't attend in advance

- Review MeetGeek summary or Slack notes if you miss the meeting

# Why This Matters:

- Improves overall meeting flow and efficiency

- Respects everyone's time and preparation

- Reinforces trust and professionalism

# Process 85 - Bi-Monthly Cross-Team Friction Feedback Cycle

# Context & Problem:

Miscommunications or misalignments across departments slow down delivery—but teams rarely have a space to report or analyze them.

# Goal:

Goal:Create a light, recurring mechanism to surface cross- functional inefficiencies and celebrate what works.

# Process:

Form sent every 2 months (Slack/Notion):

? Where did another team block you?  ? What wasn't clear?  What worked well this month?

HR  $^+$  CEO review results

Output  $=$  Internal heatmap report

File: TeamFrictions_Report_MMYY.pdf

Location: Stored in Notion  $>$  Internal Analytics

# Benefits:

Surfaces invisible blockers across teams

Builds proactive culture of improvement

Provides leadership with data for strategic adjustments

Celebrates effective cross- functional collaboration

# Process 86 - You Must Speak Up When You're Overwhelmed

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Delays, burnout, or quality breakdowns often stem from silence—not skill. When people stay quiet about being overwhelmed, issues surface too late and harm the whole team.

# Obligation:

Obligation:If you're stuck, blocked, or overloaded—you must let someone know. Silence is never the right move.

# What To Do:

What To Do:-  $\mathcal{O}$  Message your lead or PM directly in Slack-  $\bullet$  Be honest: "I'm not sure how to do this" is always better than silent panic-  $\bullet$  Support will be given—no judgment, no penalty

# Why This Matters:

Prevents avoidable failure

Creates a culture of support, not stress

Demonstrates maturity, not weakness

# Section 8: Managing Change

Section 8: Managing ChangeThis section defines how organizational changes—whether strategic, operational, or structural—must be communicated internally to preserve alignment, clarity, and trust. Each change initiative should be accompanied by a structured communication plan that ensures employees are informed, engaged, and given a channel for input.

# Process 87 - Internal Communication Strategy for Organizational Change

# Context & Problem:

When change occurs, teams are often left in the dark—or worse, misinformed.

# Goal:

Support all org- wide changes with a structured internal communication plan.

# Elements:

Strategic communication plan per change

multi- channel communication: Slack, Intranet, email, meetings

Two- way feedback → input and questions answered

Manual: Internal_Communication_Strategy_Manual.pdf

Campaigns Tagged: ChangeComm_[initiative]

# Benefits:

Increases transparency during key changes

Prevents misinformation and fragmentation

Encourages employee engagement via feedback loops

Strengthens trust and clarity during transitions

# Process 88 - Internal Communication Strategy for Organizational Change

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Changes often happen in silence, causing resistance or confusion. Employees often fear change not because they oppose improvement, but because it threatens familiarity. They may worry they won't be able to adapt to the new approach or feel overwhelmed by learning something unfamiliar. Habits create comfort—and when those habits are disrupted, it can trigger anxiety or resistance. Effective change communication must acknowledge this emotional layer and support people through the transition with clarity, reassurance, and learning scaffolds.

# Goal:

Goal:Support change through clear, timely, and multi- channel internal communication.

# Actions:

Actions:- Communication plan for each change initiative- Use multiple channels (newsletter, Slack, meetings)- Enable bidirectional feedback- Guide: Internal_Change_Communication_Strategy_2025. pdf

# Section 9: Field Onboarding & Training Systems

This section outlines the structured onboarding protocols for field- based roles like mappers. These systems are designed to minimize operational risk, reinforce standard procedures, and support skill transfer through observation and mentorship.

Process 89 - "Shadow Mode" Training System for New Mappers

# Context & Problem:

New mappers often make preventable mistakes if they're left to work alone too soon, which can compromise data quality and client confidence.

# Goal:

Introduce a structured, progressive shadowing system that ensures new mappers learn by observing before they operate independently.

# Training Structure:

Mission 1: - Junior mapper shadows a senior - Observes full operation, no hands- on task execution Mission 2: - Junior performs  $30 - 40\%$  of mapping - Under full supervision from a senior

# Tracking:

Training is logged in FormazioneMappingLog.csv- Progress is reviewed before solo assignments- Also used during tool transitions or major SOP updates

# Benefits:

# Section 10: Commercial Compliance & Client-Facing Protocols

As Hidonix scales its product and partnerships, consistent and compliant behavior across all commercial- facing roles becomes critical. This section defines the core obligations and responsibilities that protect our legal position, financial integrity, and client relationships.

These processes apply to anyone who communicates externally with prospects, partners, or clients- - including sales, pre- sales, marketing, partnerships, and leadership. They are designed not to restrict initiative, but to protect the credibility of the company and ensure clarity between internal promises and external delivery.

# Process 90 - Mandatory Signature of the "Sales & Product Responsibility Agreement"

# Context & Problem:

Inconsistent messaging and unauthorized promises during the sales cycle can result in contractual risk, client dissatisfaction, and brand erosion. Some reps may use unofficial materials or speak about unreleased product features without realizing the impact.

# Goal:

Ensure all commercial staff acknowledge and agree to a clear code of conduct when representing the Hidonix product externally.

# Agreement Covers:

- Use of official materials only (e.g., pitch decks, case studies)- Prohibition on mentioning unreleased modules or features- All custom offers, pricing, or timelines must be pre-approved by PM or Finance- Signature required via digital HR workflow- Agreement stored in both HR (Factorial) and Finance shared folders

# Why This Matters:

- Ensures legal and messaging compliance- Prevents overpromising or misrepresentation- Promotes accountability and disciplined sales execution

# Owner:

Sales Enablement + Legal + Finance

# Logged in:

Factorial (HR system) + Shared Finance Drive

# Process 91 - Commercial Materials Use Policy: Only Validated Versions Allowed

# Context & Problem:

Sales and marketing teams often reuse outdated decks or locally saved files, which can lead to off- brand messaging, incorrect promises, or reputational risk—especially with investors and strategic partners.

# Goal:

Ensure that all externally used commercial materials come from approved sources, are up- to- date, and reflect official Hidonix positioning.

# Policy Rules:

- Only use materials from the approved Google Drive folders- Decks and documents must have:    
- A "valid until" tagOR- A last-updated date within the last 3 months- Files used outside these criteria will be flagged and corrected by Sales Ops or Enablement- This rule is embedded in the Sales & Content Use Policy, signed during onboarding

# Benefits:

- Maintains a controlled, consistent brand message- Creates an auditable trail for compliance and investor readiness- Encourages professional discipline and alignment

# Section 11: Partner Program Governance & External Enablement

Systems to evaluate, support, and scale external partner performance with accountability and strategic alignment.

Hidonix's strategic partnerships play a vital role in product distribution, localized support, and client expansion. This section outlines how we manage external partner performance, maintain alignment with internal standards, and ensure consistent delivery of our brand promise—without needing to micromanage each partner relationship.

We treat partners as extensions of our team: trusted, empowered, and monitored with data.

# Process 92 - Partner Performance Monitoring and Feedback Collection

# Context & Problem:

Not all partners perform equally—but without structured visibility, it's difficult to identify support needs, improve weak links, or reinforce top contributors.

# Goal:

Track key metrics and feedback to optimize the partner program and personalize engagement.

# Metrics & Inputs Include:

- Sales volume vs. targets- Qualitative client feedback (from CS or post-project surveys)- Engagement with partner training content- Support requests and escalation rate (internal ops signals)

# How It Works:

Metrics are updated quarterly in the Partner Performance Tracker (Notion or CRM- linked sheet)- Feedback from internal teams and clients is tagged to relevant partner records- Review cycles include a feedback summary and engagement score- Used to tailor partner support, training, and incentives

# Benefits:

Performance- based support

Data- driven partner relationships

Stronger, scalable partner network

# Chapter 3: Project Management Processes

General Processes

Recurring Processes

Process 108 - Flash Updates Between Departments and PM

Owner: PM  Departments: General, PM  Category: Communication  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion, Slack, make  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Strategic updates or risks from teams don't reach the PM in time, leading to bad assumptions or late reactions.

Goal: Establish a short weekly ritual where each department shares one quick update with the PM.

# How It Works:

- Every Wednesday or Friday, each team lead sends a 1-paragraph update via:

- Slack- Voice message

Short written Loom if needed

Topics include:

Delivery status- Risks- Important decisions or client input

Make logs updates into a "PM Weekly Summary" database

Tools: Slack + Notion (auto logged via Make)

# Benefits:

Short, async alignment- No meetings required- Continuous awareness without micromanagement

Process 109 - Monthly "Closed Decision" Report  $\rightarrow$  CEO Reads, Doesn't Ask

Owner: PM  Departments: CEO  Category: Communication, Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: General, NAS & Drive  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: CEO shouldn't have to ask for status—visibility must be automatic and proactive.

Goal: Send a monthly PDF of all completed directives.

Content:

- What was done- When- Outcome- No comment required—just visibility

# Process 110 - Bimonthly Progress Loom from PMs

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Other  Type: General Process  Tools: General  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: It's hard for the CEO, leads, and stakeholders to get a visual sense of how a project is evolving- - especially when updates are buried in text or tasks.

Goal: Create short, regular, visual progress reports that bring clarity and visibility to strategic initiatives.

# How It Works:

Every 2 weeks, the PM records a 3- minute Loom video covering: O What was done since the last update O What's coming next O Current risks, blockers, or support needed The Loom is saved in the project folder and shared with: O CEO O Leadership O Investors (if applicable)

Tools: Loom  $^+$  Notion folder

# Benefits:

Gives context beyond checklists Scales communication across teams Improves stakeholder trust and alignment

# Process 111 - Annual Validation Cycle of the Operational Framework

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Legal & Compliance  Type: General Process  Tools: General

# Related Process IDs: N/A

Objective: Maintain a living governance structure that adapts with the company.  Problem: Hundreds of processes become obsolete without regular review.  Solution:

- Set up an annual review calendar for each pillar (HR, Sales, Exit, Procurement, etc.).  
- PMO or Admin triggers the review using Make.  
- Updates tracked with version control + changelog.

File: FrameworkReview_Calendar.xlsx

Tags in Notion: NeedsReview, Validated, Outdated

Ownership & Accountability

# Process 112 - Assign a Clear Owner to Every Module or Function

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Ownership & Accountability  Type: General Process  Tools: ClickUp, Notion, Make  Related Process IDs: N/A

Goal: Avoid ambiguity and delays by assigning a single operational Owner to each project area—no shared responsibility, no confusion.

# Actors Involved:

- Owner: Can be a Developer, UX, PM, or Salesperson, depending on the topic- Project Manager: Ensures that every task/module has an Owner assigned and tracked- Team Leads: Support the Owner but do not replace them

# Tools:

Tools:- ClickUp  $\rightarrow$  Custom field called Owner for every task, feature, or deliverable- Notion  $\rightarrow$  Mirrors ownership in each module section (auto- synced or manual link)- (Optional): Slackbot / Make can alert when tasks lack an Owner or if inactivity is detected

# How It Works:

1. At Kickoff or Sprint Planning:

Every task, module (e.g., frontend UI, backend API, robotic unit, image recognition), or external delivery must have a named Owner.

2. In ClickUp:

Use the Owner custom field for each card/task  $\longrightarrow$  shows up in task views, dashboards, and reports.

3. In Notion:

Within each section of a project (e.g., "UX", "Backend", "Delivery to Client"), list the Owner name visibly. Add a profile link for reference.

4. Responsibilities of the Owner:

- Track and push forward the execution (progress, blockers, timelines)- Communicate status updates in stand-ups, handovers, and weekly PM syncs- Update relevant documentation (Notion, Confluence, NAS folders)- Coordinate with others, but they remain the reference person at all times

5. If the Owner Changes:

It must be updated both in ClickUp and Notion, with handover notes written or recorded (e.g., Loom).

# Frequency:

- Must be set for every item before work starts- Reviewed weekly by PMs or during sprint retros

# Benefits:

Benefits:- No more diluted responsibility- Clear point of contact for any topic- Enables async clarity, especially cross- timezone- Supports traceability during audits, handovers, or board reviews

# Team Sync

# Process 113 - Recorded Meetings with Tags & Timepoints

Owner: PM

Departments: General

Category: Communication, Team Sync

Type: General Process

Tools: Loom, MeetGeek, NAS & Drive, Notion, Zoom & Meets

Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Not everyone can attend every meeting, and important takeaways are often lost or buried.

Goal: Record all key meetings and tag topics and highlights for fast review and future access.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- Weekly reviews, retrospectives, CEO briefings, and demos are recorded via Loom or Google Meet- After the meeting, meeting organizers add:  - Tags: e.g., "UX Decision", "Timeline Change", "Tech Debt"  - Timestamped summary in Notion

- Each recording is saved under the relevant project or in a shared "Meeting Archive"

Tools: Loom or Google Meet  $\longrightarrow$  Notion

# Benefits:

- Allows async alignment- Supports accountability and review- Saves time for those who can't attend live

# Documentation

Process 114 - Unified Documentation Hub for Internal & External Projects

# Process 115 - FAILLOG: Documenting Mistakes to Avoid Repetition

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Documentation, Team Sync  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion  Related Process IDs: 12

Context & Problem: When bugs, design errors, or wrong decisions occur, they're often discussed briefly and forgotten. The result? Teams repeat the same mistakes—losing time and credibility.

Goal: Create a lightweight, team- editable log to document what didn't work, what was learned, and how to avoid it next time.

# How It Works:

For every project, create a file called faillog.md (or a Notion page titled "Fails & Fixes") Anyone on the team can add entries after releases, sprints, or post- mortems Each entry includes: O What didn't work O What we learned O How to prevent this in the future The tone is constructive, not accusatory. The log is accessible to everyone, including new joiners.

Tools: GitHub Wiki or Notion  (Optional: link from milestone task in ClickUp)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Promotes continuous learning- Prevents knowledge loss- Builds operational maturity over time

# Process 116 - "Point of Truth" per Area

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Team Sync  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: With too many tools and versions, no one knows which data is reliable. Different teams use different sources for the same thing.

Goal: Establish a single source of truth for each company domain. "If it's not there, it's not real."

# How It Works:

1. Define one platform or space per department:

Sales  $\longrightarrow$  HubSpot O X Dev roadmap  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp O Design system  $\longrightarrow$  Figma library O Strategy  $\longrightarrow$  Notion master page

2. Create a Notion page: Company Points of Truth

Context & Problem: Important documents go untouched for months or years because nobody is responsible for reviewing them.

Goal: Assign a Review Owner and automate reminders for regular updates.

# How It Works:

Every strategic document has: Review Owner Next Review Date

Make sends a Slack/Email alert: O If the review is overdue Or to confirm the document is still valid

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Maintains content health- Prevents silent drift- Easy to distribute responsibility

# Process 118 - Audit/M&A Documentation Package

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Team Leads & Managers  Category: Documentation

Type: General ProcessTools: NAS & Drive, NotionRelated Process IDs: N/A

Owner: PM  Departments: Executive, General, PM  Category: Planning & Strategy, Team Sync  Type: General Process  Tools: ClickUp, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: During planning, calls, or execution, high- value ideas often emerge—but if they're not immediately actionable, they get lost or forgotten. They disappear into Slack threads, mental notes, or are replaced by more urgent tasks.

Goal: Create a structured system to preserve, revisit, and activate ideas that are valuable, but not urgent.

# How It Works:

1. Every idea that's "not for now" is added to a "Later" section

- A shared Notion space or ClickUp list called: Incubation / Later Ideas- Each entry includes:- Short description of the idea- Why it matters- Status: "to revisit", "needs validation", "pending alignment"- Suggested timeframe or trigger condition

2. Temporary Owner Assigned:

- Usually the person closest to the idea: Lead Dev, UX Lead, PM- Their job is only to ensure the idea is kept alive—not to execute it now

3. Monthly Ritual:

- On the last Friday of every month, the CEO or PM hosts a 15–30 min async or live review- Ideas are evaluated: archive, promote, or keep in incubation

Tools: Notion board or ClickUp list  $\longrightarrow$  Slack reminders

# Benefits:

- Protects strategic thinking from being lost in urgency- Creates a backlog of innovation opportunities- Enables better long-term planning and roadmap development

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Ownership & Accountability, Planning & Strategy  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: If a key person disappears, gets sick, or resigns, projects stall and knowledge is lost.

Goal: Create a lightweight business continuity plan for every project—focused only on essentials.

# How It Works:

1. In each project's Notion or ClickUp space, add a section called "Emergency Access"

2. It includes:

- Current status (last update, current blocker, open questions)- Backup contacts / alternate owners- Where to find docs, code, credentials (links only)

# Date of last review/update

3. PMs or leads are responsible for keeping this updated at each milestone or handoverTools: Notion embedded section  $\longrightarrow$  Template  $\longrightarrow$  Slack reminder every 60 daysBenefits:

# Benefits:

Ensures continuity in case of absence Reduces risk of single- point failure. Easy for others to step in when needed

# Process 161 - Live Risk Register per Project

Owner: PMDepartments: PMCategory: Planning & Strategy, Quality & ControlType: Project- RelatedTools: Asana, ClickUp, Notion, MakeRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Risks are only reported when they've already caused problems.

Goal: Make risk reporting proactive and structured across every project.

# How It Works:

Each project has a  $\triangle$  Current Risks box in Notion- Examples: delays, blockers, team availability, technical uncertainty- If a risk is marked open for more than 72 hours, Make triggers:- Slack ping to lead team- Optional follow- up with PMBenefits:

# Benefits:

Early awareness of threats Forces shared ownership Helps resolve before escalation

# Process 162 - Operational Rules per Project

Owner: PM  Departments: General, PM  Category: Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Asana, Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Each team manages projects differently, which causes confusion, unclear ownership, and broken rituals.

Goal: Create a shared "how we operate" page per project, with basic rules and expectations set upfront.

# How It Works:

At project kickoff, the PM creates a Notion page listing:

- At project kickoff, the PM creates a Notion page listing:    
- Official Slack channel    
- Who makes decisions (per area)    
- Where documentation lives    
- Active rituals (weekly stand-up, Friday update, etc.)

Each team member must read and acknowledge this page

Tools: Notion + Slack

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Clarifies roles and flow- Makes onboarding into the project easier- Reduces friction and overlaps

Process 163 - Per- Department Info Checklist (Completed by Leads)

Owner: PM  Departments: Design, Development, PM

Category: Communication, Documentation, Team SyncType: Project- RelatedTools: Forms, Notion, SlackRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: PMs waste time chasing fragmented inputs from each department. Everyone provides different levels of detail, in different formats, at different times.

Goal: Create a standardized checklist per department that team leads must fill out for each new project before execution begins.

# How It Works:

A structured checklist is prepared for each function (Notion form, Notion Form, or ClickUp form):

Dev: Required time, technical risks, dependencies, resource availability- UX: Figma status, number of revisions planned, expected handoff date- QA: Key risk zones, configuration needs, testing tools, and test window

The PM shares the form with team leads during the project setup phase

The completed checklists are:

- Saved in the shared Notion project space- Visible to CEO and PMO for transparency- Reviewed before assigning timelines or deliverables

Tools: ClickUp Form or Notion DB + Slack notification

# Benefits:

- Predictable inputs from all teams- Fast scoping with fewer assumptions- CEO and PMO have visibility from the start

# $\circledcirc$  Process 164 - Visual Kickoff for Cross-Team Strategic Projects

Owner: PM  Departments: General, PM  Category: Planning & Strategy  Type: Project- Related  Tools: MeetGeek, Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Projects involving multiple teams often begin with poor alignment, unclear ownership, and late- stage misunderstandings.

Goal: Establish a fast, visual kickoff format to align all teams before execution starts.

# How It Works:

1. For projects involving  $^{2 + }$  departments, kickoff includes:

A FigJam or Notion board visualizing. O Objectives O Flow/sequence O Owners per phase O Risks or open questions

2. A 30-minute kickoff call is held:

Each team gives input Conflicts are resolved early O All comments are added directly on the board

3. The call is:

Recorded with MeetGeek  - Anyone who misses it must leave a comment or a 60- sec Loom follow- up by EOD

Tools: FigJam / Notion + MeetGeek + Slack  Effect:

Shared understanding before execution  Minimal time investment

- Fewer misaligned assumptions later in the project

# Process 165 - "Shared Expectations Letter" at Kickoff

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Communication, Planning & Strategy  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Notion, Signature Tools  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Unspoken client expectations cause friction later—especially around response times, scope, or revision rounds.

Goal: Set explicit boundaries and shared commitments at project start.

# How It Works:

PM prepares a document outlining:

$>$  Response times  $>$  Revision limits  $>$  Project phases  $>$  Decision- making process

- Document is signed by the client digitally and archived

Tools: Notion + PDF export + eSignature

# Benefits:

- Prevents conflict  
- Speeds up escalations  
- Clarifies what is (and isn't) included

# Process 166 - "In Scope / Out of Scope" Table (Publicly Visible)

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Deployment & Delivery, Documentation  Type: Project- Related  Tools: NAS & Drive, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Clients request changes or additions that were never part of the agreement—creating conflict.

Goal: Maintain a side- by- side scope visibility document, accessible to internal teams and clients.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- The PM creates a 2- column table:      - In Scope: listed deliverables and commitments      - Out of Scope: anything explicitly excluded or not agreed upon- Shared at project kickoff and updated if anything changes- Linked in the project folder and optionally embedded in the contract

Tools: Notion Table or PDF

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Prevents scope creep- Quick reference for Sales and PMs- Avoids "but I thought it was included" discussions

# Process 167 - "Project Alliance" Between PM and Department Leads

Owner: PM  Departments: Design, Development, PM  Category: Communication, Team Sync

Type: Project- RelatedTools: Notion, Slack, MakeRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Project Managers often request information or commitment from department leads but receive vague, incomplete, or delayed responses—especially when there's no agreed way of working together.

Goal: Establish a lightweight but clear operational agreement between the PM and all involved team leads before each execution phase begins. This ensures shared ownership and expectations from day one.

How It Works:

1. At the start of each project (before active development begins), the PM creates a shared page in Notion titled "Project Alliance".

2. The page outlines:

- Key roles and responsibilities per team- Preferred communication method (Slack thread, async form, or short check-ins)- Intermediate deadlines and key checkpoints- How updates and escalation will be handled

3. Each involved lead (Dev, UX, QA, Sales, etc.) reviews and agrees on the content.

4. The agreement is approved informally via:

- Slack reaction (✓)- Short comment- Optional email confirmation

5. The "Project Alliance" is:

- Pinned in the Notion project folder- Shared in the main Slack project channel for visibility

Example Use Case:

A project involving Dev, UX, and QA:

- Dev agrees to respond within 24h to blockers

- UX agrees to complete revisions before the start of implementation- QA agrees to send test coverage plans before delivery reviews- The PM agrees to summarize status every Friday and flag risks via Slack

Tools: Notion (Project Alliance template) + Slack thread + optional Slack reminder via Make

# Benefits:

- Clear expectations before execution- Fewer miscommunications during delivery- Stronger sense of partnership and accountability- Easy to refer if conflicts arise

# Process 168 - Co-Signed Document Before Execution Phase

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Documentation, Ownership & Accountability  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Teams often begin execution without shared clarity on goals, responsibilities, and what "done" means.

Goal: Require a jointly signed agreement between the PM and each department lead before starting any execution phase.

# How It Works:

- Before execution begins, the PM prepares a "Phase Agreement" in Notion:    
- Objectives    
- What defines completion    
- Owner per deliverable    
- Known risks or blockers

# Key timing and checkpoints

Each team lead adds a comment or emoji to confirm- Link is shared in the project Slack thread- Stored in the Notion project folder

# Benefits:

Eliminates ambiguity Creates shared accountability Helps PM manage follow- ups with clarity

During Project Processes (Phase 2)

# Process 169 - Internal "Project Started" Announcement

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Sales  Category: Communication, Team Sync  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Without alignment, departments miss early steps and responsibilities.

Goal: Auto- notify teams that a new client project is active. Slack Message Includes:

Client name Purchased modules Assigned team Kickoff date Upcoming milestones

Triggered via Make from signature confirmation

# Process 170 - Focused Check-in Calls Only Between PM and Team Leads

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Team Leads & Managers  Category: Team Sync  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Google Calendar, MeetGeek, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Project meetings include too many people, waste time, and blur decision- making. PMs get feedback from team members without strategic context.

Goal: Limit operational and planning conversations to PM + Department Leads only—in short, high- signal check- ins.

# How It Works:

PM schedules 15- minute alignment calls with:

Dev Lead  O UX Lead  O QA Lead  O Other relevant leads

These check- ins:

Replace broad team calls  Focus on risks, dependencies, and upcoming deliverables  Are recorded via MeetGeek if others need to listen later

Leads collect feedback from their teams and report insights

Tools: Google Calendar + MeetGeek + Slack follow- up

# Benefits:

Tighter, faster sync  Less interruption for operational teams  Information flows through leadership, not noise

# Process 171 - Client Calendar with Reasoned Shifts

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Communication  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Notion  Related Process IDs: 141, 142

Context & Problem: Clients get upset when timelines change—but often, they don't see the internal logic or alternatives.

Goal: Keep clients aligned and proactive by sharing a mini calendar view of project health and timing.

# How It Works:

PM shares a simplified calendar (PDF or Notion page) with:  - Milestones  - Current risk areas  - Alternative delivery proposals

(e.g., deliver Phase 1 now, Phase 2 in 10 days)

- Calendar is updated weekly and accessible in read-only format

# Process 201 - Internal PM Handoff Protocol

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Team Sync  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: When a PM transitions out of a project, knowledge often gets lost or scattered.

Goal: Create a structured Handoff Folder for any internal PM transition.

Handoff Includes:

- Project status summary  
- Timeline + milestones  
- Open issues  
- Active stakeholders  
- Key recent decisions  
- Shared in Notion + Slack tag to successor

# Benefits:

Smooth continuity No guessing for the new PM. Easier PMO backup coverage

# Process 202 - Post-Call Clarification Memo

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Communication, Documentation  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, MeetGeek, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: High- pressure or confusing client calls often end with verbal commitments no one remembers—or misinterprets.

Goal: Create a short written recap after unclear or critical calls, shared and archived.

# How It Works:

After the call, PM creates a 3- point memo: O What was actually requested? O What was explicitly agreed upon? O What requires internal alignment? Memo is sent to the client for confirmation  $^+$  saved in project folder

Tools: MeetGeek  $^+$  Notion or PDF export

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Reduces misalignment- Protects both sides- Documents the "real story" of complex interactions

# Process 203 - Feasibility Window Response System

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Sales  Category: Communication  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, Hupsot, Slack  Related Process IDs: 141, 143

Context & Problem: Clients demand unrealistic delivery times, and teams don't know how to reply without saying a flat "no."

Goal: Build a transparent, option- based response framework for timing negotiation.

How It Works: For each client request, PM defines 3 timelines:

Minimum time (if team drops everything) Focused time (with priority shift) Realistic time (within roadmap)

The client receives all 3 options, with trade- offs noted (quality, roadmap impact). Tools: Slack / Email / HubSpot templates

# Benefits:

- Builds client trust- Gives PM leverage- Protects roadmap and internal balance

# Process 204 - "No/But/When" Response to Client Requests

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Sales  Category: Communication, Other  Type: Project- Related

Tools: Email, Hupsot, Slack Related Process IDs:N/A

Context & Problem: Saying "yes" to everything creates chaos; saying "no" creates tension.

Goal: Introduce a structured way to say "no" constructively.

How It Works: For each impossible request, the response follows 3 parts:

X No: "That won't be feasible as requested..." But: "We can offer an alternative that's more sustainable..." When: "And we could deliver it by [realistic date]"

Templates are used in Slack, Email, or HubSpot

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Protects team- Maintains client relationship- Builds negotiation skillset internally

# Process 205 - Change of Scope Protocol

Owner: PM Departments: PM Category: Deployment & Delivery Type: Project- Related Tools: Notion, Slack Related Process IDs:N/A

Context & Problem: Clients request changes mid- project, and the team implements them informally causing chaos.

Goal: Standardize how changes after contract signature are requested, evaluated, and approved.

# How It Works:

1. The client submits a Change Request form

2. PM evaluates:

Technical impact- Timeline- Cost or delivery change

3. If accepted:

A formal Contract Addendum is generated- Signed and stored with the original agreement- Work only begins after sign- off

Tools: Notion Form + Addendum PDF template + Slack notifications

# Benefits:

Full control of mid- project changes- Legal compliance- Budget and delivery integrity

# Process 206 - Structured Follow-Up Emails + Auto-Reminders

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Communication, Legal & Compliance  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, Slack, Make  Related Process IDs: 214, 216, 219, 220

Context & Problem: Clients forget about follow- ups. PMs chase approvals or feedback with no response.

Goal: Standardize follow- up messaging and trigger auto- reminders.

# How It Works:

Every strategic email follows this format:

vbnet CopyEdit

Hello [Client],

We're following up on [topic]. If we do not receive a reply by [date], we will proceed with [assumed action]... If no response in 48h:  $\bigcirc$  Make sends reminder email  $\bigcirc$  Slack alert to PM for escalation

Tools: Gmail  $^+$  Make  $^+$  Slack

# Benefits:

Predictable process Client accountability PM workload reduced

# Process 207 - Using MeetGeek to Track Approvals in Calls

Owner: PM Departments: PM Category: Documentation, Quality & Control Type: Project- Related Tools: Email, MeetGeek, NAS & Drive, Notion Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Clients verbally agree to things in meetings, but later claim they didn't.

Goal: Record all key client meetings and auto- tag approvals for confirmation.

# How It Works:

MeetGeek records client calls Al tags phrases like:

- "Let's go ahead"- "Approved"- "Yes, do that"

Recap PDF is exported and sent to the client:

"Here's what you approved during the call..."

# Benefits:

- Proof of verbal decisions- Removes ambiguity- Helps during disputes or revision control

# Process 208 - Client Feedback Loops Must Be Respected

Owner: PM  Departments: General  Category: Communication  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, MeetGeek  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Some contributors ignore or deprioritize client feedback, especially when busy. Obligation: If you're working on a client- facing project, you must read, respond to, and integrate feedback within expected timeframes.

You Must:

- Review client comments (via Slack, ClickUp, MeetGeek)- Acknowledge revisions- Accept critiques without defensiveness- Don't delay the communication loop

# Why This Matters:

- Supports client trust- Speeds up approval

- Makes delivery feel polished and professional

# Process 209- Critical Client Communication Template (Delays, Bugs, Slips)

Owner: PM  Departments: Executive, PM  Category: Support & Warranty  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: When problems arise, inconsistent communication makes things worse.

Goal: Send a clear, structured message for every critical issue affecting clients. Template Includes:

- Transparent explanation  
- What we're doing  
- New timeline  
- Point of contact  
- Optional goodwill compensation

Process 210 - "Decision Timeout" Policy with Implied Approval

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Quality & Control  Type: General Process  Tools: General  Related Process IDs: 214, 215, 219, 220

Context & Problem: Decisions (UX, naming, features) are blocked for days because the client never replies.

Goal: Set a fixed timeout window after which silence = implicit approval.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- PM notifies the client:  - "You have 3- 5 working days to respond. After this, your silence will be considered approval."- Each timeout is tracked in a Client Silent Approvals.csv- Used for:  - Text confirmations  - Bug handling  - Flow sign- offs

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Keeps project moving- Transparent and documented- Avoids fake misunderstandings later

# Automations

# Process 211 - Automated Stakeholder Comms (Internal & External)

Owner: PM  Departments: PM, Sales  Category: Communication  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, General, Notion, Slack, Make  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: PMs spend too much time manually updating stakeholders about milestone progress.

Goal: Automate key milestone communication without extra work.

# How It Works:

Each milestone completion triggers a Make flow: o For external: client email update o For internal: Slack update in #product / #client o For leadership: status update on CEO's Asana or Notion view

Tools: Make  $^+$  Slack  $^+$  Notion  $^+$  Email (SendGrid or native SMTP)

# Benefits:

No duplicated effort Reliable updates Keeps everyone in sync without extra pings

# Process 212 - PM Notifications for Key Mapping Events (Without Data Exposure)

Owner: PM  Departments: Data Acquisition, PM, Team Leads & Managers  Category: Communication, Deployment & Delivery  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Email, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: PMs need real- time visibility but should not receive any sensitive field data.

Goal: Send automated updates with abstracted mapping milestones only.

Auto- Triggers (via Make):

Mapping Started Area Complete (zone ID only, no site name) Problem Logged Upload Completed (sample file only)

- QA Test Performed (on synthetic file)- Sent to PM Slack or email, no sensitive location or identifiers

# Benefits:

- Live mission control- Privacy preserved- Operational transparency

# End Project Processes (Phase 3)

# Process 213- Standard Project Closing Message (Celebration + Recap)

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Communication, Team Sync  Type: Project- Related  Tools: Forms, Loom, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Many projects end quietly, with no sense of closure, recognition, or documented final reflection. This weakens culture, motivation, and learning.

Goal: Introduce a standard project closing ritual that gives every release or delivery:

- A proper wrap-up- A visible announcement- A moment to reflect and improve

# How It Works:

1. When a project is officially closed:    
- PM or Owner records a short Loom Recap Video (1-3 minutes)

$\longrightarrow$  What was delivered, key challenges, major learnings

2. Send a Slack message to a dedicated channel (e.g. #releases): less CopyEdit

Project [Project Name] has been officially closed!

3. Here's what's included:

Docs: [Notion link] Loom Recap: [Loom link] Feedback Form: [Notion Form]

4. Thanks to everyone involved!

5.

6. Trigger a Feedback Form:

Lightweight, async form with 3- 5 questions: What went well? O What didn't work? O Any suggestions for the next project?

Tools: Loom  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  Slack  $\longrightarrow$  Notion Form (or Typeform)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Gives closure and recognition- Builds a learning loop for future projects- Improves documentation quality- Reinforces a strong, transparent culture

# Process 214 - "From Idea to Release" Final Project Review

Owner: PM  Departments: PM  Category: Documentation, Team Sync  Type: Project- Related

Tools: General, NAS & Drive Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Some parts of a project remain open- ended, undocumented, or unvalidated—causing drift or incomplete closure.

Goal: Formalize project closure by reviewing the full lifecycle—from vision to client delivery.

Owner: PM Departments: PM Category: Team Sync Type: Project- Related Tools: MeetGeek, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Projects end, but teams jump into the next one without reflecting on what worked and what didn't.

Goal: Introduce a light, structured retrospective at the end of each mid- to- large project.

# How It Works:

After every project longer than 2 weeks, the PM schedules: O A short live retro O Or an async form shared via Slack or Notion The output is stored as: O What worked O X What didn't O What we'll do differently next time

Linked to the project folder

Tools: Notion  $^+$  Slack  $^+$  MeetGeek (optional)

# Chapter 6: Data Acquisition Processes

Overview: This chapter consolidates all processes relevant to the Data Acquisition (DA) team, organized chronologically to reflect the actual flow of field operations. The goal is to reduce confusion, ensure consistency, and support smoother cross- team coordination.

To improve clarity and usability, the processes are grouped into three operational phases:

- Pre-Trip – planning, preparation, and pre-deployment alignment- Onsite (During Trip) – execution, live check-ins, and field updates- Post-Trip – data transfer, documentation, and retrospective actions

Each section outlines the relevant tools, responsibilities, and communication touchpoints expected at that stage. By aligning the content to the real- world lifecycle of a mapping mission, this handbook becomes more actionable and intuitive to use.

This is a living document. As our workflows evolve, this structure helps us continuously improve, minimize ambiguity, and onboard new team members more effectively. This version includes only the most operationally critical processes extracted from the full Hidonix Handbook.

Pre- TripProcess 366 - Data Acquisition: Daily Sync via Slack Bot

Owner: Data AcquisitionDepartments: Data Acquisition, PMCategory: Team SyncType: Project- RelatedTools: Notion, SlackRelated Process IDs: N/AContext & Problem: The Data Acquisition (DA) team often works on- site or off- platform, making them invisible in day- to- day workflows. This results in missed updates, unknown blockers, and lost visibility for Dev and PMs.Goal: Implement a daily async check- in via Slack to keep the DA team aligned and visible, without needing meetings.

How It Works:

1. Every weekday morning during mapping operations, a Slack bot asks each DA team member: O "What are you doing today?" O "Any problems yesterday?"

2. Responses are collected and pushed into a Notion page or shared log, organized by day and user 
3. Dev and PMs can check this log at any time to:

O Understand daily progress O Anticipate field issues O Coordinate with backend, image recognition, or navigation teams

Tools: Slack bot  $\longrightarrow$  Notion log page

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Async visibility of field operations- Lightweight communication—no calls neededInforms cross- functional teams about DA progress and issues

Chapter 7: UX/UI Design Processes

# Full Ownership Processes

Processes where Department is involvedTo

To start a project:

# Process 401 - CEO Product Vision Dashboard (Guiding Strategic Input)

# Goal:

Goal:Standardize how the CEO shares product vision to avoid execution delays and misalignment.

# Actors:

Actors:- CEO (provides direction)- UX/UI Team (starts from CEO inputs)- Project Managers (align specs and priorities)- Developers (understand purpose and constraints)

# Tool:

Notion (main dashboard), Loom (embedded videos), Figma (optional sketches)

Suggested addition: Whimsical for quick flows or diagrams

# How it works:

A Notion dashboard called "CEO Direction" is created by the CEO, divided by product/feature and then shared with UX/UI, Development and PMs.Each section includes:

Each section includes:

- Vision & objective- Minimum requirements- Design guidelines- Priority ranking- Loom video (2–3 min max)- Optional: Figma sketch, Timeline

# Frequency:

Update monthly or with every new initiative.

# Benefit:

Allows all teams to align with CEO direction without needing live calls. Promotes autonomy, clarity, and consistent product execution.

To not involve too many people in the beginning stages:

# Process 402 - Gradual Visibility System for Internal Projects

# Context & Problem:

Involving too many people too early often creates confusion, off- topic feedback, or frustration.

# Goal:

Control visibility over a project depending on its phase of maturity, to protect fragile ideas and involve people at the right time.

# How It Works:

Projects follow 3 phases of access:

1. Stealth Mode

Access: CEO + UX

Goal: explore the idea without pressureFormat: internal draft, design concepts, tone exploration

# 2. Early Team Mode

Access:Dev+QA+PM Goal: start building, defining scope, testing feasibility

# 3. Cross-Department Reveal

Access: Sales, Marketing, Customer SuccessGoal: storytelling, go- to- market planning, internal presentations

Each phase has its own Notion section and ClickUp visibility settings.

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Focuses attention where needed- Reduces noise and premature feedback- Helps launch with clarity and confidence

After Process 401, once we've identified the core problem or defined what needs to be built:

# Process 403 - Modular Work Blocks (From Concept to Delivery)

# Context & Problem:

Large projects often suffer from too many interdependencies: delays in one team block others, and small deliverables get buried inside big releases.

# Goal:

Goal:Divide work into independent, self- contained modules that can be owned, tracked, and shipped autonomously.

# How It Works:

Break each product into functional modules (e.g., login flow, CMS dashboard, image recognition pipeline)

Each module is treated like a mini product, with: Dedicated Owner Own UX, Dev, QA scope Clear deliverables and test plan

Modules can be developed internally or outsourced, and delivered independently.

# Tools:

ClickUp (per module folder)  $\longrightarrow$  Notion (specs + dependencies)  $\longrightarrow$  Slack (updates)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Speeds up execution- Reduces dependency overhead- Enables clearer delivery ownership and flexibility

# Notes:

Notes:- Requires prior creation of shared internal libraries for frontend/backend components

Once we break down the project into functional modules:

# Process 404 - Visual Asset Production Pipeline With Fixed Timing

Owner: DesignDepartments: Design, MarketingCategory: Deployment & Delivery, Quality & ControlType: General ProcessTools: Forms, NotionRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Design cycles often spiral into endless feedback rounds and lost files.

Goal: Create a clear, time- bound workflow for visual asset production.

# Steps:

1. Request form + Notion template  
2. Sketch → feedback  
3. Final render → 1 review only  
4. Approval/rejection within 48h

Tracked in: VisualCreationPipeline.xlsx

Once the timeline for the modules is set, make sure to regularly update the progress status so it's visible to everyone:

# Process 405 - Internal Public Roadmap with Live Progress

# Goal:

Allow all teams to see actual progress status (not just "feeling") across products and modules—clearly, visually, and updated.

# Actors Involved:

PMS (own data), Devs (update status), CEO/Stakeholders (view/report)

# Tools:

- Notion Page → "Product Radar"- Progress % fields from ClickUp (via Zapier/Make)- (Optional): Table view, Kanban, or multi-status cards

# How It Works:

1. Create a Notion Page called "Product Radar"  Lists each active product or module

- Shows real % of completion- Contains:  
- Links to task lists  
- Spec and documentation  
- Key bugs open/closed  
- Last update timestamp

# 2. Progress is not estimated manually

- Pulled via automation from ClickUp % completion- Updated every Friday (via Zapier, Make, or Notion API)

# Purpose:

- Avoid misalignment between perception (e.g. "80% done") and reality- Helps Sales/Marketing know what's near-ready- Builds trust and strategic awareness internally

# Frequency:

Auto- updated weekly on Friday Used in Monday syncs and monthly reviews

Keep the sales team in the loop since the beginning:

# Process 406 - Involve Sales & Marketing from Day 1 (and Keep Them in the Loop)

# Goal:

Eliminate silos by involving Sales & Marketing from the start of every product or feature and maintaining their connection throughout development.

# Actors Involved:

CEO, UX/UI, Marketing Team, Sales Team, Developers (selective), PMs

# Tools:

- Notion – "Pitch & Sales" section inside each project- ClickUp – tag marketing/sales visibility on feature cards- Loom – quick video updates for alignment- (Optional): Slack #product-marketing channel

# How It Works:

# 1. At Phase 2 - Analysis:

- A Pitch & Sales sheet is created in Notion.- Filled out collaboratively by CEO, UX/UI, and Marketing.- Includes:

- Value Proposition- Suggested Product Name- User Personas- Draft site sections or headlines- Loom from CEO or PM (early concept explanation)

# 2. Ongoing Communication with Dev Team:

- Key ClickUp tasks/features include a Marketing/Sales Visibility tag

Devs may be asked to:

Record Looms on how things work- Answer specific UX/flow questions- Join dedicated calls when features have storytelling impact

# 3. Sales & Marketing Weekly Sync (15-20 min):

- Marketing updates roadmap + delivery expectations- Sales prepares client-facing materials in advance- Ensures landing pages, decks, demos, and FAQs are not reactive

# 3. Development, Sales & Marketing Weekly Sync (15-20 min):

- Share technical details of new features (e.g. Challenged, improvements, version differences)- Provide technical documentation, and demos of new features

# Frequency:

- Start at Phase 2- Updated during weekly product/marketing sync- Sales/Marketing must review all feature-ready milestones

# Benefits:

- Sales knows what's coming – no delays at launch- Marketing builds accurate, high-conversion messages early- Developers understand how features will be positioned- Stronger internal alignment = faster external impact

# Research Stage

In this phase, designers conduct research to gain a deep understanding of their users and their needs. This research helps them create empathy for their users and understand what they need from the product or service.

Both user research and market research are necessary components of this phase. User research can take many forms, such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and ethnographic studies. Market research looks at things like industry trends and competitive analysis.

# Low-Fidelity & Mid-Fidelity Stage

In the planning phase, designers take all the information they gathered in the research stage and start to plan out how they'll meet those needs. They develop user personas, user stories, wireframes, and other high- level plans during this phase.

After creating the low- fidelity & mid- fidelity wireframes, we can start creating the shared UI components:

# Process 407 - Shared UI & Micro-Frontend Library

# Context & Problem:

Teams often rebuild UI components (like buttons, forms, alerts) because they don't know reusable versions already exist- or they aren't documented.

# Goal:

Goal:Save development time and increase consistency by creating a design + code system of shared UI components.

# How It Works:

Designers create and maintain a Figma Design System with reusable visual components- Developers contribute matching code snippets (micro- frontends) stored in GitHub- A Notion "UI Component Library" links design + code, with preview, usage rules, and owner per component

# Tools:

Figma  $\longrightarrow$  GitHub  $\longrightarrow$  Notion master index

# Benefits:

- Faster development- Unified look and feel- Easier onboarding for new developers

Once we start creating the high- fidelity wireframes:

# Process 408 - Design Integrity Team

# Context & Problem:

As a product grows and multiple designers or developers work across modules or markets, the visual coherence starts to break:

- Different shades of color- Inconsistent button behavior- Clashing typography- Confusing naming conventions- Repeated components with minor variations

This weakens the user experience, damages the brand, and causes extra tech/design debt later on.

# Goal:

Goal:Create a lightweight governance layer that regularly monitors and preserves the visual and functional consistency of the product across teams and releases.

# How It Works:

# 1. Assign a Design Integrity Role:

This can be a dedicated person (e.g. UX Lead) or a small team (2- 3 rotating members) Their mission is to check- not block- visual consistency

# 2. Monthly Check Activities:

Spot- check 2- 3 active products or modules

Review:

UI consistency (spacing, colors, components) Behavior patterns (modals, dropdowns, feedback) Component naming and reusability Updated visual documentation in Figma / Notion Consistency between design and implementation (dev handoff)

# 3. Feedback Loop:

Notes go into a shared doc (or a Figma file with comments) Actionable feedback is assigned via ClickUp to responsible team

Tools: Figma  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp (issue follow- up)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Brand and product consistency- Less design debt- Easier onboarding for new devs and designers- Better cross- product alignment over time

# Notes:

Notes:Tokenization (e.g. spacing, color variables) and reusable component libraries (e.g. Storybook) should complement the visual QA effort. This makes consistency easier to maintain and aligns Dev and UX practices.

# Prototyping Stage

Once you have a working UI, it's time to turn it into a working prototype. Prototyping allows you to present a more realistic experience for your usability testing, which can then deliver more accurate feedback and insight into "what's working" and "what's not working".

Prototypes can be low- fi or hi- fi, and they can be created using a variety of tools, such as InVision, Justinmind, and Axure.

\*TBD: Process of getting the Design Approved

Define who will be responsible for approving the designs and establish how the approval process will work- - e.g., by scheduling a presentation day, setting up a review meeting, or collecting async feedback.

\*TBD: User Testing Stage after getting the Design Approved

It's better to conduct user testing before handing off the design to developers, so we can identify and address any usability issues early.

After user testing, if testing goes  $\times$  unsuccessfully:

$\rightarrow$  Redesign based on feedback & go back to getting the design approved then repeating user testing

After user testing, if testing goes  $\checkmark$  successfully  $\rightarrow$  define how to manage handoffs to developers:

# Process 409 - Minimum Release Package Template

# Context & Problem:

Every team or release owner tends to manage handoffs differently. As a result, some features go live:

Without QA validation With outdated documentation Without internal announcement or assets for marketing

This inconsistency creates confusion, bugs, and missed opportunities.

# Goal:

Goal: Define a minimum set of deliverables that must be completed before closing any release—ensuring quality, alignment, and readiness across departments.

# What the Template Includes

Every release (even minor) must check off the following items:

1. Task Completed- All subtasks and linked items are resolved in ClickUp

# 2. QA Passed

- Bug log reviewed- Critical issues resolved and retested

# 3. Loom Video Created

- Short walkthrough explaining what was built, how it works, and where to find it- Used by team members, Sales, and Marketing

# 4. Figma Updated

- UI reflects final state- Design tokens, components, and states are cleaned and archived

# 5. Documentation Saved

- Feature added to Notion with:

- Description- Owner- Release notes- Known limitations

# 6. Marketing Notified

- Feature is added to the Go-To-Market sync- Visual and messaging needs confirmed- If public: timeline agreed with Marketing

# How It Works:

- The template is integrated into ClickUp or Make- Each release card includes a "Release Checklist" subtask or automation

- Makecan prevent a release task from being marked complete unless all boxes are checked

# Tools:

Tools:ClickUp checklist or form  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  Loom  $\longrightarrow$  Slack (for marketing sync) Optional: Make blocker automation

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Guarantees release consistency- Reduces chaos for QA, Marketing, and Sales- Ensures traceability and internal understanding- Scales as you grow with minimal overhead

After the feature has been fully developed, conduct internal testing:

# Process 410 - "Live Inside the Feature" (Internal Use Before Client Release)

# Context & Problem:

Sometimes features are released to clients without anyone on the team having really used them. This leads to:

- Bugs missed- UX confusion- Sales/Marketing unprepared for how to position the feature

# Goal:

Goal:Make every feature live internally for at least 48 hours before public/client release, to gather real feedback and preempt issues.

# How It Works:

# 1. As soon as a feature is marked "ready for testing":

- A Slack thread is created, called "Live Testing 
- [Feature Name]"- Everyone in the team is invited to try it: Devs, PMs, UX, Marketing, Sales- Encourage feedback of any kind—bugs, UX confusion, copy, usefulness

# 2. Ownership:

- Managed by PM or UX Lead- They collect input and push actionable feedback to Click Up

# 3. Optional:

- PM/Dev does a short Loom walkthrough to explain how to test or where to look- Feedback is tagged in Click Up for traceability- extend the testing process to explicitly include UX user testing or simulated feedback sessions, when possible, to validate usability pre-release.

# Tools:

Slack  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp  $\longrightarrow$  Loom (optional)

# Benefits:

- Real-world feedback before the real world sees it- Sales/Marketing get involved before launch- Prevents embarrassing gaps after public release

Once a product or feature has been released:

# Process 411 - Unified "Release Review" Channel

# Context & Problem:

Once a feature or fix goes live, many team members—including Sales, UX, QA, and even other

# Devs-don't know what was released.

This causes misalignment, missed training opportunities, and lack of product ownership.

# Goal:

Goal:Create a central Slack channel where every release is shared, reviewed, and open to comments across departments.

# How It Works:

# 1. Channel Setup:

1. Channel Setup:- Slack channel: #release-review- Visible to all departments

# 2. For every release (even small):

Dey or PM posts:

NEW What was released Related tasks (ClickUp link) Notes if anything still needs to be tested Optional Loom with walkthrough or visual changes

# 3. Cross-Team Comments Welcome:

Anyone can comment with:

Questions Feedback Suggestions Praise

# 4. Optional Weekly Digest:

Make/Slackbot compiles all entries into a Monday digest

# Tools:

Slack  $\longrightarrow$  Loom (optional)  $\longrightarrow$  Click Up task links  $\longrightarrow$  Make (digest automation)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Builds shared product awareness- Encourages constructive, asynchronous feedback- Reduces silos between Dev, UX, Marketing, QA, Sales- Makes quality part of company culture, not just code

Owner: PMDepartments: General, PMCategory: Planning & Strategy, Team SyncType: Product- RelatedTools: Asana, ClickUp, NotionRelated Process IDs: 11

Context & Problem: Product teams and stakeholders often confuse strategic features with one- off client requests.The roadmap becomes a mess.

Goal: Visually and structurally separate product development into three clear tracks to help everyone understand what's core, what's a test, and what's custom.

# How It Works:

1. Create a "Product Map" page in Notion (or board in ClickUp) Split features into three labeled categories:

Core - Long- term, strategic, foundational parts of the platform

(e.g., authentication, CMS core, navigation engine)

Experimental - Tests, MVPs, innovation pieces being validated

(e.g., SmartParking AI add- on, new AR interface)

Custom - One- off or client- specific features not meant for the general product

(e.g., museum- specific integration, white- labeled UI)

2. Each feature includes:

O Owner O Link to design/spec O % progress O Delivery date

3. Updated weekly by PMs or Tech Leads

Used in all product reviews and planning

Tools: ClickUp (with tags/labels)  $\longrightarrow$  Notion (for visual product map)

# Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: With multiple teams, modules, and experiments, it's hard to know which products exist, which are still supported, and which are in development.

Goal: Build a simple, visual map of all products and modules, with their current state and documentation—accessible by everyone.

# How It Works:

1. Create a Notion board or visual map called "Hidonix Product Map"2. Each product/module includes:

O Product name O Status: Active, In Development, On Hold, Deprecated O Owner O Link to technical and business documentation O Notes on target user, industry, client use (if any)

3. Teams can use this for:

Deciding what to pitch Planning integrations Understanding internal platform maturity

Tools: Notion board  $^+$  Make(optional Slack ping for updates)

# Benefits:

Company- wide visibility Reduces duplicated efforts Helps Sales, PM, and Tech align on what's real and ready

Context & Problem: Docs meant for external use are sometimes sent before full internal approval—causing inconsistencies or risk.

Goal: Ensure every document goes through cross- team validation before client- facing use. Approval Chain:

1. Dev writes/updates  
2. PM checks completeness  
3. CEO or CTO signs off (if strategic)  
4. CMO receives final approval for external use

# Process 420 - Knowledge Handoff from Team Leads to PM

Owner: PM  Departments: Design, Development, PM  Category: Documentation, Team Sync  Type: Product- Related  Tools: General  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: PMs often lack the technical or UX background to write complete briefs on their own.

Goal: Require knowledge transfer sessions from each team lead to the PM before planning starts.

# How It Works:

- Each team lead shares:    
- Dev: technical logic, backend requirements    
- UX: design reasoning, edge cases

QA: fragile zones, known failure patterns

The knowledge is shared via:

Loom O Short Notion doc Slack message  $^+$  links

The PM uses this input to create:

Internal roadmap brief External client- facing proposal

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Stronger, well- structured brief- Less revision or misalignment during delivery- Promotes PM autonomy

# Process 423 - Mandatory Internal Demo Every Time a Feature Is Released

Owner: Product  Departments: Development, Marketing, Product, Sales  Category: Team Sync  Type: Product- Related  Tools: Google Calendar, Notion, Zoom & Meets  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: If Sales is not trained on a feature before launch, they cannot present it confidently or accurately.

Goal: Every new feature entering "Post- QA" must be explained in a live or recorded demo accessible to Sales within 72h.

# How It Works:

Dev/UX host 20- min live or Loom demo Sales must attend or watch replay in 3 days Only after  $\longrightarrow$  feature is considered "presentable" Tracked via Google Calendar  $^+$  recap in Notion

# Benefits:

Zero misalignment Immediate readiness Stronger demos and pitches

# Process 424 - Sales: Early Product Access Tracker

Owner: PM  Departments: Development, Marketing, PM, Sales  Category: Communication, Team Sync  Type: Product- Related

Tools: Loom, Notion, Slack Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Sales often learns about new features after they're released—missing early demo opportunities.

Goal: Give Sales early visibility on internal features in final QA phase, so they can prepare and pitch in time.

# How It Works:

1. When a feature is entering final QA, PM or Dev Lead adds it to a Notion page called "Early Access Products"

2. The entry includes:

- Feature name and owner- Pitch summary (1-liner)- Demo Loom (optional)- Value proposition- Ready-to-share deck- Expected release date

3. Slack #sales-drop channel posts each new entry- Sales can book internal demo or note potential leads

Tools: Notion  $\longrightarrow$  Slack  $\longrightarrow$  Loom (optional)  $\longrightarrow$  Pitch Deck (PDF)

# Benefits:

ID Phase Zero: Vision Kickoff + NPI Foundation Document

Context & Problem

Hardware products often launch into development without a shared baseline on intent, constraints, or user context. This leads to inconsistent decisions, misaligned expectations, and rework between Industrial Design, Engineering, and Product.

# Goal

Establish a unified, documented foundation for every hardware product before CAD begins—aligning stakeholders on purpose, constraints, aesthetics, and development direction through a structured NPI (New Product Introduction) document.

How It Works

Stakeholder Kickoff Meetings

Organized by the Lead Industrial Designer or PM, with participation from:

CEO/Product Vision Holder

Lead Industrial Designer

Hardware Engineer / R&D

Field Ops (if applicable)

Sales / Marketing (observer role, optional)

Organized by the Lead Industrial Designer or PM, with participation from: Focus:

User problem and context

Aesthetic and brand expectations

Functional and field- based constraints

Prior art / competitive landscape

- Timeline assumptions

# 2. NPI Foundation Document

Prepared by the Lead Industrial Designer in collaboration with PM. Stored in Notion or Google Drive and shared org wide.

Sections Include:

Product Purpose (Why we're building this) Target User & Use Environment Design Intent & Brand Language Preliminary Sketches or Moodboards Known Constraints (Space, Materials, Budget, Timeline) Product Differentiators / Competitive Gaps Suggested Materials / CMF Notes Risks / Unknowns NPI Owner and review cadence

# 3. Async Sharing & Sign-Off

Shared in Slack with relevant leads tagged. Comments due within 48 hours  $\rightarrow$  feedback loop closes in Notion.

Tools: Notion / Google Docs, Slack, Loom (optional), Figma / Miro

# Benefits:

- Prevents early ambiguity and misalignment

- Gives ID a strong voice in early direction

- Accelerates downstream DFM and sourcing decisions

- Visible to non-design stakeholders

Pre- Dev Feasibility Testing: ID + Engineering Validation Sprint

Context & Problem

A product idea may look promising on paper, but fail when physical constraints like weight, balance, response time, material strength, or assembly logic are tested. Teams often realize this too late in development.

# Goal

Before formal development begins, ID and Engineering collaborate on a feasibility testing sprint, based on early requirements listed in the PRD, to validate product assumptions, de- risk key features, and structure the path forward.

How It Works

Step 1: Define Feasibility Metrics in PRD

After the NPI document is approved and the Product Requirements Document (PRD) is drafted, the Industrial Designer and Robotic/Mechanical Engineer list key test metrics such as:

- Weight limits/balance threshold- Grip test or usability with gloves

Size/form constraints for a target user

Max acceptable speed (if moving part)

Assembly or snap- fit force validation

Thermal/durability (if relevant)

Each test is tagged as:

Critical (must- pass)

Exploratory (inform decision- making)

Step 2: Build Basic Test Rigs or Lo- Fi Prototypes

Design + Eng collaboratively create:

3D- printed test blocks or foam dummies

Simple rigs to simulate movement or mounting

Balance or torque test with weights

Analog mockups to validate user interaction

Step 3: Conduct & Document

Execute tests across 2- 3 scenarios

Record videos, measurements, and notes

Use a shared Notion table:

Metric tested

Result / Pass- Fail

Observations

Proposed design adjustments (if needed)

Execute tests across 2- 3 scenarios

Step 4: Iterate and Feed Back Into Design

Insights are reviewed in a 30- 60 min design- eng sync

Needed design changes are updated in CAD

Notes added to PRD + ClickUp comments

Risk items flagged for stakeholder awareness

# Stakeholders

Lead Industrial Designer (test planning, physical mockups)

Mechanical Engineer / R&D (rig design, load analysis, data)

PM (sync schedule, integration into PRD timeline)

Field Ops / QA (optional for extreme use- case simulation

# Tools:

Figma / Notion for PRD + test planning

ClickUp (test checklist linked to feature)

Google Sheets / Notion table (test log)

# Benefits

Prevents wasted dev time on unbuildable ideas

Strengthens alignment between ID and Engineering

- Produces real data to guide design refinements- Enables smoother transition from concept to detailed CAD- Improves trust and communication across functions

PRD + POD Sign- Off: Formalizing Product Fundamentals Before Dev

Context & Problem

Too often, teams move into development with assumptions instead of agreements. Features shift, priorities blur, and the absence of formal alignment causes rework, miscommunication, or even product failure.

# Goal

Translate validated insights from feasibility testing into a clear, structured Product Requirements Document (PRD)—paired with a Project Overview Document (POD) that defines scope, roles, and critical constraints. These are signed off by all key leads before development begins.

How It Works:

Step 1: Create PRD from Feasibility Testing

Led by the Lead Industrial Designer and PM, the PRD includes:

- Product Goal (pulled from NPI)

Key Features & Functions

- Validated Metrics from Process 61 (e.g., weight limit, force threshold, usage conditions)

- Design/Engineering Constraints

- Success Criteria / KPIs

- Open Questions / Risks

Stored in Notion and linked in ClickUp under the project parent task

Step 2: Draft Project Overview Document (POD)

Created collaboratively by PM, CEO, Lead Industrial Designer, and Tech Lead. This is a 1- 2 page high- level project contract that includes:- Project Title + Summary

Project Title  $^+$  Summary

Strategic Intent (from CEO or Product Vision)

Scope of Work (What's in / out)

Feature List (Locked)

Roles & Owners

Timeline Milestones

Dependencies

Sign- off Section: checkboxes for CEO, ID, PM, Tech Lead, QA Lead

Step 3: Final Review & Digital Sign- Off

Shared as a final checkpoint in Slack

Leads must comment or sign within 48 hours

Project cannot move to full development until POD and PRD are marked in ClickUp

# Stakeholders

Lead Industrial Designer (design direction + specs)

Project Manager (POD coordination + delivery control)

CEO / Vision Holder (strategic alignment)

Engineering Lead (technical feasibility sign- off)

QA (to review testable outcomes)

# Tools

- Notion for PRD + POD

- ClickUp to track review status + dependencies

- Slack reminder / Loom overview if async

- Optional: PDF export of POD for record-keeping

# Benefits

- Creates shared clarity before development- Prevents scope creep and ambiguity- Locks down feature set with leadership alignment- Reduces conflict across ID, Eng, PM during execution- Ensures testable, feasible specs from Day 1

Modular Hardware Development Blocks

Context & Problem

Just like backend modules, hardware consists of subsystems (e.g., enclosures, mounts, fasteners) but lacks standardized documentation and ownership.

# Goal

Break hardware products into modular blocks with clear documentation, assigned owners, and QA paths.

# How It Works

Divide the product into modules: outer casing, mounting bracket, power enclosure, etc.

Assign Owner in ClickUp

Each module includes:

CAD + BOM- Material and tolerance notes- Assembly method- Test/QA instructions

# Stakeholders:

Lead Industrial Designer, Mechanical Engineer, PM, QA

Tools: ClickUp  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  CAD repo

# Benefits:

- Enables parallel development- Promotes reuse and auditability

Clarifies who owns each part of the product

# ID + R&D Joint Prototyping Week

# Context & Problem

Industrial Designers and Engineers often work asynchronously, leading to gaps in feasibility, assembly logic, or form integration.

# Goal

Create a focused sprint- style week each quarter where Industrial Design and Engineering collaborate hands- on to iterate, prototype, and align early.

# How It Works

- Schedule 1 collaborative sprint week per quarter- Co-locate or sync Industrial Designers + Mechanical Engineers + R&D- Activities include:

- Lo-fi mockups (foam, cardboard, clay)- Basic 3D prints or CNC- Fit/handling checks with actual hardware

- End-of-week critique and documentation

Stakeholders: Lead Industrial Designer, Mech/R&D, PMTools: Slack channel, Notion for summary, shop/lab accessBenefits:

# Benefits:

- Reduces post-CAD conflicts

- Builds real-world integration intuition

- Strengthens cross-functional trust and speed

Field Feedback Loop for Physical Products

Context & Problem

Post- deployment physical feedback often stays informal or unstructured leading to repeated issues and missed improvement opportunities.

# Goal

GoalFormalize a lightweight, recurring process for collecting and acting on field feedback specific to hardware design.

# How It Works

- After launch, Field Ops or Sales completes a Notion form:

- What failed or degraded?

- What confused the user?

- Suggestions for future rev

- Photos, videos, and notes encouraged

- The Lead Industrial Designer reviews feedback every two weeks with Eng + PM

- Action items added to ClickUp or the backlog

Stakeholders: Lead Industrial Designer, Field Ops, PM, QA, R&D

Tools: Notion form  $\longrightarrow$  Slack digest  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp

Benefits:

- Closes the loop from field to design

- Boosts iteration intelligence

- Aligns product quality with real use

# Hardware Design Release Checklist

Context & Problem

Without a structured checklist, releases can ship with missing dimensions, vague material specs, or undocumented assembly logic.

# Goal

Standardize the final quality gate for every hardware design release, ensuring readiness for prototyping, manufacturing, and deployment.

# Checklist Includes:

Checklist Includes:- ✓Final CAD (STEP + native)- ✓2D Drawings with tolerances- ✓Bill of Materials (materials + finishes)- ✓Exploded views and assembly order- ✓Risk notes or critical dimensions- ✓DFM confirmation from vendor- ✓Field- tested iteration report (if applicable)

Stakeholders: Lead Industrial Designer, Mech Eng, PM, QA, Vendor (optional)

Tools: ClickUp template task  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  NAS CAD Vault

# Benefits:

Creates manufacturing confidence

Ensures design traceability

Reduces release errors and miscommunication

# Process 444 - 2FA & Access Control for Sensitive Folders

Owner: Bonzo

Departments: , Finance & Admin, HR, Legal Team (In house Counsel)

Category: Documentation, Legal & Compliance

Type: General Process

Tools: NAS & Drive, Signature Tools

Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Sensitive files (HR, legal, strategy) are sometimes too accessible—or hidden from those who need them.

Goal: Enforce strong, role- based access and 2FA security on critical folders.

# How It Works:

Critical folders (e.g., HR, legal contracts, roadmap) are:

O Locked via NAS ACL O Access controlled by group permissions O Protected with 2FA login

Every access is:

O Logged in an audit trail O Reviewed quarterly

Unusual access triggers alerts to Legal/Admin

# Benefits:

Benefits:- High- level security- Traceable data handling- Legal protection and compliance

Timeline: The policy applies each time a user logs in to the document repository (NAS) Actors Involved: All employees with a document repository account

Access is granted based on group membership (e.g., HR, Legal)

Only authorized groups can view/edit the relevant folder content

Notes: It is not possible to enable 2FA directly on a specific folder. However, 2FA can be enforced at the user login level. Folder access can be restricted to specific users through ACLs, and for enhanced security, folders can be encrypted with a password.

# Process 445 - NAS Backup + Cross-Continent Mirror

Owner: Bonzo  Departments: IT  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS & Drive  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: If a local NAS goes down (fire, blackout, data loss), critical files become unavailable or lost.

Goal: Set up automated backups and geographic redundancy for maximum reliability.

# How It Works:

- Daily incremental NAS backup (Synology HyperBackup or rsync)- Mirror between Italy and USA every 48 hours- Encrypted cloud copy stored on:    
- AWS S3    
- Wasabi    
- Backblaze B2

- Restoration test every 3 months

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Full disaster recovery- Ensures business continuity- Complies with redundancy and audit standards

Timeline: Real- time synchronization occurs between the NAS in the USA and the NAS in Italy whenever a new document is uploaded.

Initial configuration is performed using predefined shared folders and will be updated each time new shared folders are added.

Incremental backup will be configured based on rules to be defined, once the appropriate backup solution is in place- - specifically, the purchase of a new NAS dedicated solely to backup operations.

Actors Involved: System Administrator is responsible for configuring the two real- time synchronization jobs between the USA and Italy NAS systems, creating any new shared folders, and setting up the backup process on the third (dedicated) NAS.

# Process 446 - Access Log for Critical Documents

Owner: Bonzo  Departments: HR, IT  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS & Drive, Signature Tools  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Sensitive documents are viewed or downloaded without traceability—creating legal or privacy risks.

Goal: Enable read and download tracking on all sensitive content.

# How It Works:

Documents marked as "Sensitive" (contracts, NDAs, strategic roadmaps) are:

Stored in a folder with access logging enabled- Access log is reviewed weekly by Admin or Legal- Alerts are sent if:- Access occurs outside working hours- Access comes from unauthorized IPs or locations

Tools: NAS ACL + Audit logging (Synology DSM or similar)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Detects unauthorized behavior- Audit- proof traceability- Legal- grade protection

# Initial Setup:

Creation of "Sensitive" folders on the NAS with ACL- based access restrictions- Activation of file access audit logging- Definition of access control criteria (e.g., HR, Legal teams)

Recurring Weekly Task:

System Administrator performs a weekly review of access logs to identify unusual or unauthorized activity and shares with Admin or Legal

Real- Time Monitoring (Ongoing) for every access

Actors Involved: Bonzo, Admin/Legal Team

# Process 447 - Time-Limited External Links

Owner: Bonzo  Departments: Finance & Admin, General  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS & Drive, Notion, Make

# Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: External document links stay open for weeks or months—creating risk of leaks or misuse.

Goal: Enforce expiration limits on all shared NAS links.

# How It Works:

- Default expiration: 7–14 days  
- Links require:    
- Password    
- Download tracking    
- Auto-disable upon expiration  
- Admin reviews expiring links weekly

Tools: NAS link sharing with expiry + Makeoptional alerts

# Benefits:

- Prevents uncontrolled access  
- Reduces forgotten exposure  
- Improves data hygiene

# Timeline:

When a link is created:

- The user sets an expiration date (default: 7–14 days) and a password.

Every week:

- The admin checks active links and disables any that should not be shared.

Actors Involved: All NAS users and System Administrator

# Process 448 - Controlled Sharing with External Vendors

Context & Problem: Vendors sometimes receive more access than needed—risking security or IP leaks.

Goal: Create a controlled access protocol for third- party providers.

# How It Works:

- Each vendor gets:    
- Access only to their folder    
- IP-restricted or time-limited links    
- NDA signed before any file access- Access is logged and reviewed quarterly

Tools: NAS + NDA template + IP restriction config

# Benefits:

Limits external exposure Maintains professionalism Ensures legal coverage

# Timeline:

Before access is granted:

Vendor signs an NDA A personal folder is created with limited access

Every quarter:

Access logs are reviewed by IT or Legal

Actors involved: Sys Admin, Legal Team, External vendors

Goal: Tie every key release to the people who made it happen.

How It Works:

Each feature/release in ClickUp or Notion includes: o Who developed, designed, tested, or shipped it O QA pass rate O Time to fix bugs (if any) O Feature impact level (basic/strategic/core)

Compiled monthly into a "Release Log" for each person

Context & Problem: Marketing teams work fast, but tech validation is often skipped- - leading to messaging that's inaccurate or misleading.

Goal: All external materials must be reviewed by PM/CTO before publishing to ensure factual consistency with current capabilities.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- Review done within 24h max- Checklist: claim accuracy, module maturity, correct naming- Logged via ContentApprovalLog on Notion

# Process 469 - External QA: Two-Stage Bug Validation Flow

Owner: Ciccio, Luigi

Timeline: Every time a bugfix is deployed on Staging (QA) environment

Actors: Development team, Robotics & Engineering

Departments: Development team, QA team

Category: Deployment & Delivery, Quality & Control

Type: Product- Related

Tools: ClickUp, Slack, Make

Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: When bugs are found and fixed, no one verifies whether the fix actually works unless explicitly requested. This leads to recurring issues, frustration, or even regressions in production.

Goal: Introduce a two- step QA validation flow, where every bug goes through detection and verified fix by the QA team- - automated, structured, and visible. When bugs are added to ClickUp, they must include the steps required to reproduce the bug, including Loom video.

# How It Works:

How It Works:1. Two Bug States in ClickUp:- Detected  $\rightarrow$  reported by external QA- Verified Fixed  $\rightarrow$  retested and confirmed by QA after fix

2. Flow:

2. Flow:- Dev marks the bug as "Fixed" in ClickUp- Makedetects this change and automatically pings the QA team in Slack (e.g., "Bug #102 marked as fixed. Please verify.")

3. QA retests the bug:

If : marks it "Verified Fixed" If  still not resolved: bug reopens with comment

Tools: ClickUp (status flow)  $\longrightarrow$  Make (automation)  $\longrightarrow$  Slack (QA ping)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Ensures all fixes are confirmed- Builds trust in the QA process- Adds accountability across Dev and QA without slowing down

# Process 470 - Backend Modules with Clear Rules & Responsibilities

Owner: Backend team, Robotics & Engineering team Timeline: Every time a new feature is developed Actors: Backend team, Robotics & Engineering team Departments: Development, Robotics & Engineering Category: Deployment & Delivery, Documentation

Type: Product- Related Tools: IDE (for source code), Swagger (for APIs), GitLab

Related Process IDs:N/A

Problem: Our backend is becoming complex. Even if everything is in one repo, there are many separate parts (auth, export, billing, integrations...).

Right now, it's hard to:

Understand what each part does

- Know who to ask- Test something without asking Devs- Avoid breaking something by mistake

# $\circledcirc$  Goal

Make each backend "block" (auth, export, search, etc.) easier to understand and test—without needing microservices or splitting the repo.

How It Works (Simple Version)

For each important backend part/module, we do 3 things:

1. Create a README file called what-it-does.md It answers:

What this block does What it receives (inputs, API calls, data) What it gives back (outputs, responses, effects) How to test it (real examples or Postman link) Who to talk to if something breaks (Owner)

Example:

pgsql

CopyEdit

$\diamond$  What: Generates CSV of all users $\diamond$  Input: user_id, filters $\diamond$  Output: CSV file $\diamond$  To test: call/export?format=csv $\diamond$  Owner: Andrea G.

2. Assign an Owner

One dev is the go- to person for that block.

Their job:

- Keep the what-it-does.md file updated- Answer questions when others are stuck- Alert QA/PM if they change how it works

3. Make It Easy to Test

QA team must be able to test the block using Postman or scripts The Owner provides:

O Example input O Expected output O Status codes or error examples Tests are shared in ClickUp with a checkbox per test

Where It Lives

Inside the repo: /modules/module- name/what- it- does.md Also linked in Notion under "Backend Modules" page

When to Update

Every time someone changes how that module behaves PM or QA must always work with the latest version Why This Helps No more guessing what code does QA can test without asking devs PMs understand scope quickly Fewer bugs caused by unclear changes. Easier to grow the team

# Process 471 - Mobile: Automatic Demo Videos with Standard Script

Owner: Danilo

Timeline: Every time a new feature is deployed on master Actors: Mobile development team Departments: Development Category: Documentation Type: Product- Related Tools: ClickUp, Loom, Notion, Slack Related Process IDs: N/A Context & Problem: Mobile apps are hard to present and test:

Everyone shows them differently

Sales has no demo material QA lacks consistent flows Features are not documented visually

Goal: Ensure every mobile release is documented via video, following a short, clear, guided script usable by QA, Marketing, and Sales.

# How It Works:

1. For every new mobile feature or release:

The mobile developer records a Loom demo video, max 2 minutes- They follow a predefined checklist, such as:- Open the app- Perform 5 key actions- Highlight any UI changes or loading states- Confirm final behavior

2. The Loom is:

- Linked in ClickUp to the release task- Uploaded to a shared Notion "Mobile Demo Library"

3. The video can be reused by:

- QA for final tests- Sales for client demos- Marketing for previews or GTM

Tools: Loom + ClickUp + Notion + Make checklist automation

# Benefits:

- Faster testing- Clearer handoffs- No more "how does it work?" delays- Reusable material for Sales and GTM

# Process 472 - Release Blocking Checklist ("Three Locks Rule")

Type: Product- Related

Tools: ClickUp, Make

Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Features are sometimes released too fast—without being tested, documented, or communicated.

Goal: Ensure every feature release passes 3 basic validations before going live.

How It Works: Every feature must pass this checklist:

1. Documentation ready - Notion page or ClickUp task complete2. QA validated - QA checklist passed, bug log clear3. Marketing prepared - Value prop + pitch + screenshot or Loom

If one is missing  $\rightarrow$  the task stays blocked and Make prevents "Done" status.

Tools: ClickUp custom fields + Make triggers

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Prevents messy launches- Aligns product, QA, and GTM- Maintains internal product quality

# Process 473 - Multiple Looms for Key Features

Timeline: Every time a new feature is developed

Actors: Development team, Robotics & Engineering team, UX/UI team, Marketing/Sales teams

Departments: Design, Development, Marketing

Category: Communication, Documentation

Type: Product- Related

Tools: ClickUp, Loom, Notion

Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Those who build features are rarely the ones who present, sell, or design them.

This leads to documentation that is incomplete or one- sided.

Goal: Capture three coordinated perspectives for every strategic feature—technical, user, and business.

How It Works: For every important feature or release, collect:

1. * Dev Loom:    
- Technical explanation    
- API logic, behavior, edge cases

2. * UX/UI Loom:

- Design choices- User flow- Problem it solves

3. Sales/Marketing Loom:

- How to explain it to a client- Key value prop- Where it fits in the product offering

All 3 videos are:

- Uploaded to the Notion project page- Linked to the ClickUp release- Optional: Used for internal onboarding and GTM materials

Tools: Loom + Notion + ClickUp

Effect:

- Full-circle understanding of every feature- Reduces communication gaps- Enhances sales enablement and internal knowledge sharing

# Legal Team (In house Counsel) (Paolo)

At the time of drafting these procedures (July 2025), Hidonix Inc. does not employ in- house legal counsel. Legal matters referenced in this section are managed under the direction of the CFO in coordination with external legal advisors retained by the company. The CFO and internal team are responsible for overseeing the implementation of legal guidance received but are not providing legal advice and should not be construed as substitutes for licensed counsel.

Accordingly, all processes contained within the "Legal Team" section should be viewed under the company's current legal structure, as advised by third- party professionals. These procedures may be subject to revision as legal counsel is engaged or regulations evolve or may not be immediately applicable under the current legal structure. Any decision involving legal interpretation, regulatory compliance, or contractual obligations should be reviewed with qualified external counsel prior to implementation.

If anyone on the team is working on anything that involves legal risk or uncertainty, they should always check in with the CFO so it can be reviewed with the appropriate external expert

Chapter: 13 CEO Processes

SECTION 1: STRATEGY & DIRECTION

Process C1 - CEO Product Vision Dashboard (Guiding Strategic Input)

# Goal:

Standardize how the CEO shares product vision to avoid execution delays and misalignment.

Activation: Monthly or with each new initiative

# Actors:

- CEO (provides direction)- UX/UI Team (starts from CEO inputs)- Project Managers (align specs and priorities)

- Developers (understand purpose and constraints)

Tool: Notion (main dashboard), Loom (embedded videos), Figma (optional sketches) Suggested addition: Whimsical for quick flows or diagrams

# How it works:

A Notion dashboard called "CEO Direction" is created and divided by product/feature. Each section includes:

- Vision & objective- Minimum requirements- Design guidelines- Loom video (2-3 min max)- Optional: Figma sketch

# Frequency:

Update monthly or with every new initiative.

# Benefit:

Allows all teams to align with CEO direction without needing live calls. Promotes autonomy, clarity, and consistent product execution.

# Process C2 - Phase Zero: Primitive Draft by the CEO

# Context & Problem:

The CEO often has a strong vision or gut feeling about the product direction. But if it's not written down early, it gets diluted by layers of interpretation.

# Goal:

Goal:Start every internal project with a raw, unfiltered description, directly from the CEO—intended to transmit the emotional and strategic DNA of the idea.

# How It Works:

For each new project, the CEO creates a file titled "Primitive Draft" It's meant to be rough, subjective, even messy- not polished It should include:

Spirit and intention of the product Style, energy, pacing What it is / what it's not What to avoid Key examples, analogies, or inspirations

The team reads it, extracts the essence, and turns it into specs.

# Tools:

Tools:Notion  $\rightarrow$  Project folder  $\rightarrow$  "Primitive Draft" section

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Captures the founder's vision without filters- Helps creative and technical teams align early- Prevents sterile or off- track project starts

# Process C3 "-Product Narrative" - The Why Behind the Product

# Context & Problem:

Teams often focus on what to build (features, deadlines, screens)- - but lose sight of why they're building it.

This disconnect leads to:

- Features that don't solve real problems- Frustrated devs and designers- Poor stakeholder engagement- Misaligned priorities

# Goal:

Ensure every internal product, module, or initiative is born with a clear story that explains its deeper purpose, audience, and strategic role.

# How It Works:

1. Create a "Product Narrative" page at project inception (in Notion)- Short and focused (max 1 page)- Owned by CEO or delegated to UX Lead

# 2. Mandatory Questions to Answer:

Why are we building this? 2 For whom is this being built? What happens if we don't build it?

How does it connect to the product strategy or roadmap? What impact will it create- - internally or externally?

# 3. Used For:

Initial alignment of the team Decision- making throughout execution Communicating with non- technical stakeholders

# Tools:

Tools:Notion  $\rightarrow$  embedded into the full project documentation

# Benefits:

Benefits:Keeps teams focused on value, not just tasks  - Helps developers and designers feel purpose  - Builds alignment across roles  - Easy to explain project to newcomers or investors

# Process C4 - Decision Engineering (Fast vs. Structured Decisions)

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:In fast- paced environments, some decisions are made in seconds, others drag on for weeks. The issue isn't speed—it's lack of clarity on the type of decision being made.

This creates:

Dozens of small questions asked to the CEO Bottlenecks on approvals

Overthinking on minor issues Rushed judgment on big ones

# Goal:

Goal:Categorize decisions based on impact and reversibility, so that the team knows when to move fast—and when to stop and align.

# How It Works:

# 4. Two Types of Decisions:

Reversible Decisions  $\longrightarrow$  Low risk, can be changed later

Examples: naming a UI label, choosing internal tools, quick UX test

Teams decide independently (PM, UX, Dev, etc.)

Irreversible Decisions  $\longrightarrow$  High impact, long- term consequence

Examples: tech architecture changes, pricing, public roadmap, client delivery scope

Must be documented on a 1- page Decision Sheet, with:

Context Options considered Risks Final proposal

# Requires CEO or Exec approval

# 5. Implementation:

- Notion template: "Decision Sheet"- Shared folder: "Strategic Decisions"- Tag decision type in ClickUp or Slack- Optional: decision tracker integrated into the "Decision Log" (see Process 17)

# Tools:

Tools:Notion (Decision Sheet template)  $\rightarrow$  Slack/ClickUp (decision flag)  $\rightarrow$  Make (if automating tracking)

# Benefits:

Benefits:Reduces friction and micro- dependence on leadershipEmpowers fast decision- making for the reversibleProtects the company from "invisible" irreversible mistakesCreates a culture of clarity, not just speed

# Process C5- Gradual Visibility System for Internal Projects

# Context & Problem:

Context & Problem:Involving too many people too early often creates confusion, off- topic feedback, or frustration.

# Goal:

Goal: Control visibility over a project depending on its phase of maturity, to protect fragile ideas and involve people at the right time.

# How It Works:

Projects follow 3 phases of access:

# 1. Stealth Mode

Access:CEO+UX

Goal: explore the idea without pressure

Format: internal draft, design concepts, tone exploration

# 2. Early Team Mode

Access:Dev+QA+PM

Goal: start building, defining scope, testing feasibility

# 3. Cross-Department Reveal

Access: Sales, Marketing, Customer Success

Goal: storytelling, go- to- market planning, internal presentations

Each phase has its own Notion section and ClickUp visibility settings.

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Focuses attention where needed- Reduces noise and premature feedback- Helps launch with clarity and confidence

# Process C6 " -Formalized Decision" Module for Strategic Choices

# Context & Problem:

Strategic or high- impact decisions are made, but rarely recorded in a structured, reusable way.

# Goal:

Standardize how key decisions are documented and justified.

# Form Includes:

What was decided Who approved it Why (decision criteria) Alternatives rejected Estimated impact

# Process C7 " -CEO Directive" Header for Any Policy/Action/Flow Created

# Context & Problem:

When content is created from a CEO directive, it's not always labeled as such—causing confusion on authority.

# Goal:

Clearly mark all strategic documents as originating from the CEO.

Header (PDF or Notion):

# SECTION 3: COMMUNICATION AND INTERNAL CULTURE

Process C18 - Focus Friday (Strategic Short Week, Flexible Format)

# Context & Problem:

In a high- pressure, fast- paced environment, deep work, documentation, and strategic thinking are constantly sacrificed in favor of urgent tasks and meetings. However, without periodic focus, quality degrades, and long- term vision is lost.

# Concern:

Concern:In startups, a rigid no- meeting policy every Friday may backfire—especially during product releases, crisis response, or fundraising periods.

# Goal:

Goal:Protect structured time for deep work and documentation—only when conditions allow—without blocking delivery or urgent operations.

# How It Works

![](images/c3b919a6eb87f0c60fdb9e3d57cb3983cbeaab5291fae50029cfacaf28ccbc03.jpg)

# Cadence

Cadence- Focus Friday takes place biweekly or monthly (when calendar permits)- Teams choose Friday afternoon (suggested:  - Italy: 15:00–18:00 CET  - U.S.: 13:00–16:00 PT)

# Rules (During Focus Friday):

No internal meetings (unless critical) Slack activity paused (except for urgent support/emergencies) Time is used for: Completing tasks that require deep focus. Cleaning and updating documentation (Notion, ClickUp) Reviewing bugs or long- standing issues

Strategic or creative planning Refactoring, testing, tech cleanup

# Conditions for Activation

Focus Friday is skipped when:

There's a product release Client delivery or demo is scheduled The team is in a high- pressure week or emergency mode CEO or PM explicitly cancels it in advance

This is not mandatory, but a company- wide habit that activates when the schedule permits.

# Ownership & Communication

- PMs are responsible for:    
- Checking if the Friday can be kept "clean"    
- Announcing Focus Friday by Thursday EOD    
- Cancelling it if critical operations are planned

- Team members are responsible for:    
- Planning their own deep work    
- Avoiding scheduling calls or unnecessary Slack use

- Logging completed outcomes in the relevant project areas

# Tools:

Tools:Google Calendar (biweekly block)  $\rightarrow$  Slack pinned message/reminder  $\rightarrow$  Notion (optional outcome summary)

# Benefits:

Benefits:Creates space for quality thinking and workEncourages documentation and cleanupPrevents burnout by introducing predictable breathing spaceKeeps velocity without compromising delivery

# Process MO6 - 180-Day Active Document Review Cycle

Owner: Admin, PM  Departments: IT  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion, Slack, Make

# Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Policies, manuals, and SOPs become outdated fast—but no team is assigned to audit them unless a problem occurs.

Goal: Ensure every live document is reviewed and updated or archived every 6 months.

# Process:

- Each file enters a 180-day cycle  
- Make sends automatic reminder  
- Owner confirms: Still Valid / Update Needed / Archive  
- Reviewer checks if updates reflect current process

# Process MO7 - Tracking Undocumented Decisions (Decision Log Automation)

Owner: Admin, PM  Departments: General, PM  Category: Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion, Slack, Make

Related Process IDs: 20, 63

Context & Problem: Many critical decisions—especially in fast- moving environments—are made in Slack chats or quick calls.Examples:

Examples:

"Let's drop feature X for now" "Let's go with option B for the release" Marketing will handle this instead of Dev"

These decisions often don't get written down. Weeks later, no one remembers:

Who decided it? When? Why? What was the agreed direction?

This leads to confusion, double work, or silent blame.

Goal: Capture informal but important decisions automatically, without forcing the team to change how they communicate.

How It Works:

1. Trigger Phrase Monitoring in Slack:

Phrases like: "We'll go with..." "Let's do..." "The decision is..." "We agreed to..." "Final call: ..." "Let's drop / switch / shift..." These are detected by Make, which monitors selected Slack channels (e.g., #product, #strategy, #ux- dev, #ceo)

2. Make Creates an Entry in Notion:

A new line is added to a page called "Decision Log", containing:

Timestamp Slack link to the conversation Author (who wrote the message) Decision summary (auto- extracted or manually refined)

3. PMs or Admins Review Weekly:

Clean up unclear entries Tag related project/module Add context if needed (e.g., linked task or Notion page)

Tools Required:

- Slack (communication source)- Make(automation trigger and Notion API writer)- Notion (shared "Decision Log" page per team or project)

# Benefits:

- Makes invisible decisions visible- Avoids misunderstandings weeks later- No new tools or habits required—works with what people already do- Enables post-mortem clarity, auditing, and project history

Optional Enhancements:

- Add "Decision Tags" or emojis(UX, Dev, PM, Business)- Filterable view in Notion (by date, team, topic)- Weekly Slack digest: "3 decisions made this week"

# $\div$  Process MO45 - Direct Manager Visibility & Responsibility Protocol

Owner: HR, Team Leads & ManagersDepartments: GeneralCategory: Communication, Ownership & AccountabilityType: General ProcessTools: ClickUp, Email, Google Calendar, SlackRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: In cross- functional teams and fast- moving organizations, it's common for employees to receive requests, invitations, or feedback from different leaders—including the CEO.

Without structure, this leads to:

Managers being unaware of how their team members are being used- Misalignment between departments- Loss of accountability when something is missed or goes wrong

# $\circledcirc$  Goal

Establish a clear internal rule:

Your direct manager is your first point of alignment—always.No matter who asks you to do something (even the CEO), you are responsible for making sure your manager knows about it and is included.

How It Works

1. Every employee is assigned a direct manager, visible in their Notion profile and communicated clearly.  
2. If you are asked to do something—by anyone—your manager must be informed.

This applies to:

- Requests from another team or lead  
- Involvement in a meeting or planning session  
- Contributions to a task, document, prototype, or roadmap  
- Suggestions to change scope, strategy, or delivery priorities

3.  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Even if the CEO contacts you directly, you are required to:

- Mention or tag your manager in the task or comment  
- CC your manager in emails or include them in calendar invites  
- Update the task owner in ClickUp, and notify via Slack or internal chat

4. You are responsible for this communication.

It is not the CEO's or another manager's job to notify your lead.

# Examples

Scenario

What You Should Do

The CEO sends you a Slack DM asking for help on a doc

Reply and say: "Of course, I'll loop in [Manager Name] so they're aware." + tag them

You are pulled into a client call by Sales

CC your manager on the calendar invite + Slack ping to inform

PM from another team asks you to join a task

Comment in ClickUp tagging your manager as FYI

Why This Is Critical

- Your manager is responsible for:  
- Your priorities  
- Your workload  
- Your quality of execution

- Your feedback loop and support- If they are unaware of your activity, they cannot:    
- Protect your time    
- Support you in case of conflict    
- Properly evaluate your performance

# Tools to Use:

- ClickUp: mention manager in cross-team tasks- Google Calendar: add your manager to invites- Slack: ping your manager anytime you join an external initiative- Email: CC your lead on sensitive threads or client contact

# Effect:

- Maintains clear accountability- Protects team alignment- Supports professional responsibility without blocking collaboration- Empowers managers to do their job—while allowing flexibility at the edges

Process MO46 - Mandatory Buddy with Tracked Check- ins

Owner: HR, Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Team Sync, Training & Onboarding  Type: General Process  Tools: General  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: New hires often don't know who to talk to or feel unsure about asking questions. This creates isolation and slows integration.

Goal: Assign a dedicated onboarding buddy for the first 30 days, with structured check- ins and trackable support.

# How It Works:

1. Each new hire is assigned a buddy—usually from the same or a related team.  
2. 3 required check-ins are scheduled:

Day 3: "First impressions" Day 7: "Any blockers?" Day 21: "Ready to contribute?"

3. After each check-in:

- The buddy fills a short form or confirms the meeting in Notion- Slack reminder sent via Make

4. If the buddy completes the full process and gets a positive final review:  
- They receive public recognition or a badge

Tools: Slack  $^+$  Notion  $^+$  Factorial

# Benefits:

- Stronger support and culture- Faster integration- Light, measurable mentorship

# Process MO51 – You Are Personally Responsible for Assigned Tasks

Owner: HR, Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Ownership & Accountability, Training & Onboarding  Type: General Process  Tools: Asana, ClickUp, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Tasks get forgotten or abandoned because no one takes ownership—even after assignment.

Requirement:

Requirement: When a task is assigned to you, it becomes your responsibility until it's completed, escalated, or reassigned.

# You Must:

- Confirm task assignment (via reaction or comment)- Keep it updated: In progress  $\rightarrow$  Review  $\rightarrow$  Done- Raise blockers proactively- Don't leave tasks open "just in case"—close them when done

# Why This Matters:

- Builds personal accountability- Helps PMs track real progress- Reduces system noise

Owner: HR, Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General, HR  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS & Drive, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Each team manages documents differently—naming, storage, versioning—leading to chaos and inconsistency.

Goal: Create a formal documentation policy that defines standards for the entire organization.

# The Policy Covers:

- Naming conventions- Folder structure- Versioning rules- Mandatory metadata

Access permissions Scheduled reviews Each team lead must read and acknowledge it

Tools: Notion (shared PDF)  $^+$  Slack/Factorial signature

Context & Problem: Emails from clients, legal, or operations may go unreaddamaging relationships or missing deadlines.

Requirement: Check and respond to your company Gmail daily, just like Slack.

# Rules:

No email should go unread for  $>24$  hours If a full reply isn't possible yet, send a quick confirmation Mark resolved threads as "Done" or archive them properly

# Why This Matters:

Keeps client communication professional

- Prevents delays in critical workflows- Complements Slack—not replaces it

# Process MO54 - Slack/Tool Messages Must Be Answered Promptly

Owner: HR, Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Communication, Training & Onboarding  Type: General Process  Tools: Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Related Process IDs: 191, 193, 194

Context & Problem: Strategic documents go stale silently—nobody knows when they were last reviewed or whether they're still valid.

Goal: Introduce a scheduled review system that ensures regular maintenance or validation of key documents.

# How It Works:

- Each strategic document has a field: Next Review Date- Once a month, Makechecks the database and sends a reminder to the assigned document owner- The owner has two options:    
- Confirm document is still valid  $\rightarrow$  mark as "Confirmed"    
- Mark as outdated  $\rightarrow$  task auto-created for review or rewrite

Tools: Notion DB + Makereminders

# Benefits:

- No more silent decay of information- Continuous alignment- Document governance becomes proactive

Context & Problem: Anyone can modify important documents, even if they're not responsible—causing confusion or unintentional errors.

Goal: Restrict write access on sensitive files to only the assigned Owner.

# How It Works:

How It Works:- For all critical documents:      - ACL or Drive permissions = "Owner: Edit" / "Others: Read- only"- Any requested edit must be approved by:      - Document Owner      - Or an authorized Reviewer- All critical edits are logged

Owner: CEO, Product, Sales  Departments: Executive, Product, Sales  Category: Quality & Control  Type: Product- Related  Tools: Email, Signature Tools, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: At events, there's often pressure to show unreleased features. Doing so without control creates risk.

Goal: Ensure all non- public product content shown during events is formally approved and traceable.

# Rules:

- No demo unless:    
- Authorized by PM or CEO    
- NDA signed (if needed)- All requests logged via Make- Approval recorded in: EventAccessApproval.csv

# Process MO71 - Design Integrity Team

Owner: Design, Development, MarketingDepartments: Design, Development, MarketingCategory: OtherType: Product- RelatedTools: Figma, NotionRelated Process IDs: 13

Context & Problem: As a product grows and multiple designers or developers work across modules or markets, the visual coherence starts to break:

- Different shades of color- Inconsistent button behavior- Clashing typography- Confusing naming conventions- Repeated components with minor variations

This weakens the user experience, damages the brand, and causes extra tech/design debt later on.

Goal: Create a lightweight governance layer that regularly monitors and preserves the visual and functional consistency of the product across teams and releases.

# How It Works:

1. Assign a Design Integrity Role:

This can be a dedicated person (e.g. UX Lead) or a small team (2- 3 rotating members) Their mission is to check- not block- visual consistency

2. Monthly Check Activities:

Spot- check 2- 3 active products or modules Review: O UI consistency (spacing, colors, components) O Behavior patterns (modals, dropdowns, feedback) O Component naming and reusability O Updated visual documentation in Figma / Notion O Consistency between design and implementation (dev handoff)

3. Feedback Loop:

Notes go into a shared doc (or a Figma file with comments) O Actionable feedback is assigned via ClickUp to responsible team

Tools: Figma  $\longrightarrow$  Notion  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp (issue follow- up)

# Benefits:

Benefits:- Brand and product consistency- Less design debt- Easier onboarding for new devs and designers- Better cross- product alignment over time

# Notes:

Notes:Tokenization (e.g. spacing, color variables) and reusable component libraries (e.g.

Storybook) should complement the visual QA effort. This makes consistency easier to maintain and aligns Dev and UX practices.

Owner: Design, PM  Departments: Design, General, PM  Category: Quality & Control  Type: Product- Related  Tools: Internal Platform, Loom, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Sometimes features are released to clients without anyone on the team having really used them.

This leads to:

- Bugs missed  
- UX confusion  
- Sales/Marketing unprepared for how to position the feature

Goal: Make every feature live internally for at least 48 hours before public/client release, to gather real feedback and preempt issues.

# How It Works:

1. As soon as a feature is marked "ready for testing":

- A Slack thread is created, called "Live Testing 
- [Feature Name]"  
- Everyone in the team is invited to try it: Devs, PMs, UX, Marketing, Sales  
- Encourage feedback of any kind—bugs, UX confusion, copy, usefulness

2. Ownership:

- Managed by PM or UX Lead  
- They collect input and push actionable feedback to ClickUp

3. Optional:

- PM/Dev does a short Loom walkthrough to explain how to test or where to look- Feedback is tagged in ClickUp for traceability- extend the testing process to explicitly include UX user testing or simulated feedback sessions, when possible, to validate usability prerelease.

Tools: Slack  $\longrightarrow$  ClickUp  $\longrightarrow$  Loom (optional)

# Process T39 - Employees Must Understand What They're Doing (Not Just Execute)

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Training & Onboarding  Type: General Process  Tools: General  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Simply completing tasks without understanding their context leads to shallow work, repeated errors, and poor decision- making.

Obligation:

Each employee must go beyond "just doing"—they must understand why a task exists and what purpose it serves.

What This Means:

Ask questions if a task's purpose isn't clear

Understand how your work connects to product, client, or strategy

Don't proceed just to "check the box"—clarity before execution is required

# Why This Matters:

Reduces mechanical execution  Improves quality and proactive thinking  Creates real ownership and autonomy

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Communication  Type: General Process  Tools: ClickUp, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Briefs are either too technical for stakeholders, or too generic for developers.

Goal: Split every brief into Plain Language + Technical Specs.

# How It Works:

Section 1: What's the goal?  Written in clear, simple language (for PM, client, QA, CEO)  Section 2: Technical Breakdown  API, data flow, integration, logic (for Dev, QA, Tech Lead)  Shared in Notion or ClickUp and used as the source of truth

# Benefits:

Everyone gets what's happening

No dumbing down technical specs

PMs become better translators between roles

# Process T47 - "Mandatory Participation" in Strategic Docs

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion, Slack, Tines  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Strategic documents are often only read by their creators.

Goal: Introduce light but enforced participation from all relevant teams.

# How It Works:

Docs in Notion marked with  $\triangleright$  Participation Required tag

Each involved team must:

Leave a comment  Or drop a question  Or even just a "+1" within 48h

Tines tracks this  $\rightarrow$  Slack reminders for those who haven't contributed

Tools: Notion + Slack + Tines

# Benefits:

Asynchronous collaboration

Shared responsibility

Quick, non- intrusive feedback loop

# Process T48 - "Voice Required" After Strategic Meetings

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Communication  Type: General Process  Tools: Loom, MeetGeek, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: In meetings, only a few speak. Others stay passive and disengaged.

Goal: Ensure every attendee contributes after the meeting, even if they were silent during the call.

# How It Works:

Strategic meetings are recorded (MeetGeek)

After the call, each participant receives:

Their own timestamped segment

Prompt: "Add a 1- line comment or record a 60- sec Loom follow- up"

This becomes visible in the meeting notes in Notion

Tools: MeetGeek + Slack + Loom

# Benefits:

Everyone contributes

Avoids domination in meetings

Post- call engagement improves accountability

# Process T49 - "Light Documents" with Shared Sign-Off

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: Notion, Signature Tools, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Internal documents (briefs, roadmaps, presentations) often remain unread or ignored because they're authored by one person and not validated collectively.

Goal: Require multi- role validation before a document is considered "approved and operational," increasing legitimacy and buy- in.

# How It Works:

For certain key internal docs (e.g., briefs, strategic slides, simplified roadmaps), approval requires at least 3 signatures.

Typical required roles:

Dev

UX

Marketing or PM

Approval is done via:

Notion comments, checkmarks, or approval blocks

Slack reminders sent automatically to missing reviewers via TinesOnce 3 sign- offs are in place, status changes to:  $\checkmark$  Approved  $\longrightarrow$  and the document becomes the operational reference.

Tools: Notion (doc + signatures) + Slack bot (reminder via Tines) Effect:

Creates accountability

Builds shared responsibility

Ensures that documents are seen, not just stored

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Communication, Team Sync  Type: General Process  Tools: Forms, Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Misunderstandings rarely surface unless someone explicitly asks—especially in async environments.

Goal: Launch a biweekly reflection question across teams to reveal confusion points.

# How It Works:

Every two weeks, a Slack survey goes out anonymously:

"Was anything unclear to you this month?"

"Do you know who to contact for [X]?"

"What process feels fuzzy or inconsistent?"

Answers are compiled and reviewed by PMO or team leads

Tools: Slack + anonymous form (Typeform or Polly)

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS&Drive, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Some documents are meant to evolve, others should remain frozen—but it's unclear which are which.

Goal: Tag every document as either "Living" or "Fixed", to define editability rules.

# Definitions:

# Living Docs:

Always editableE.g., technical guides, internal processesStored in Notion or Drive with edit history

# Fixed Docs:

Locked after approval/signatureE.g., signed scope, contracts, legal docsStored in NAS as PDF only

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Communication  Type: General Process  Tools: Slack  Related Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Not every update needs a reply—but in Slack, silence often causes anxiety or makes messages invisible.

Goal: Create a dedicated space for operational updates that require no response—just visibility.

# How It Works:

Every team Slack channel includes a pinned section (e.g., #no_response_needed)

Task completions Status updates Notes- to- self that the team should know

No expectations for reactions, replies, or pings

# Benefits:

Benefits:Keeps everyone alignedReduces noise and unnecessary Slack threadsEncourages async clarity

# Process T56 - Localized Announcements for Time Zones

Owner: Team Leads & ManagersDepartments: GeneralCategory: CommunicationType: General Process

Tools: SlackRelated Process IDs: N/A

Context & Problem: Important messages are missed because they're posted during the "wrong" time zone for part of the team.

Goal: Ensure all important announcements are posted twice, aligned with both time zones.

# How It Works:

Announcements are duplicated in two threads:

EU zone  $\longrightarrow$  early AM CET US zone  $\longrightarrow$  early AM PT

Each thread includes:

Identical contentTargeted tags (e.g., @devs- eu, @devs- us)A shared emoji reaction for easy tracking

# How It Works:

Every Friday, the US team posts:

What we completed What we replied to from EU threads Open questions for Monday

Posted in a shared Slack channel or doc (reverse_daily_us_eu)

# Benefits:

Builds mutual responsibility  Reinforces async collaboration  Avoids silent misalignment across continents

Process T58 - Standard "Document Pack" Folder Template

Owner: Team Leads & Managers  Departments: General  Category: Documentation  Type: General Process  Tools: NAS&Drive, Notion  Related Process IDs: N/A
