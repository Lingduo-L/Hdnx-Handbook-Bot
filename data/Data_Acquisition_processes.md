## Data Acquisition

#### 📷 Process 46 – Data Acquisition: Daily Sync via Slack Bot  
**Owner:** Data Acquisition  
**Departments:** Data Acquisition, PM  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
The Data Acquisition (DA) team often works on-site or off-platform, making them invisible in day-to-day workflows. This results in missed updates, unknown blockers, and lost visibility for Dev and PMs.  

**Goal:**
Implement a daily async check-in via Slack to keep the DA team aligned and visible—without needing meetings.  

**How It Works:**

1. Every weekday morning during mapping operations, a Slack bot (via Tines) asks each DA team member:
    - 📍 “What are you doing today?”
    - 🚧 “Any problems yesterday?”
2. Responses are collected and pushed into a Notion page or shared log, organized by day and user
3. Dev and PMs can check this log at any time to:
    - Understand daily progress
    - Anticipate field issues
    - Coordinate with backend, image recognition, or navigation teams

**Tools:**
Slack bot via Tines → Notion log page  

**Benefits:**

* Async visibility of field operations
* Lightweight communication—no calls needed
* Informs cross-functional teams about DA progress and issues

#### 🗣️ Process 309 – Post-Mission Interview Between Mapper and QA/Dev  
**Owner:** Data Acquisition  
**Departments:** Data Acquisition, Development, QA  
**Category:** Quality & Control  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Some on-site issues are not visible in the data—they need to be spoken and shared.  

**Goal:**
Capture human insights immediately after upload.  

**How It Works:**

* Within 24h of data upload:
    - QA or Dev schedules a 10-minute chat or Loom
    - Asks:
    - “What did you notice that’s not in the files?”
    - “What would you change next time?”
* Notes stored in Session Feedback Log

**Benefits:**

* Captures nuance
* Improves next mission
* Builds cross-team understanding
