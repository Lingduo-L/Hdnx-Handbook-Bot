#### 📷 Process 46 – Data Acquisition: Daily Sync via Slack Bot  
**Owner:** Data Acquisition  
**Departments:** Data Acquisition, PM  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
The Data Acquisition (DA) team often works on-site or off-platform, making them invisible in day-to-day workflows. This results in missed updates, unknown blockers, and lost visibility for Dev and PMs.  

**Goal:**
Implement a daily async check-in via Slack to keep the DA team aligned and visible—without needing meetings.  

**How It Works:**

1. Every weekday morning during mapping operations, a Slack bot (via Tines) asks each DA team member:
    - 📍 “What are you doing today?”
    - 🚧 “Any problems yesterday?”
2. Responses are collected and pushed into a Notion page or shared log, organized by day and user
3. Dev and PMs can check this log at any time to:
    - Understand daily progress
    - Anticipate field issues
    - Coordinate with backend, image recognition, or navigation teams

**Tools:**
Slack bot via Tines → Notion log page  

**Benefits:**

* Async visibility of field operations
* Lightweight communication—no calls needed
* Informs cross-functional teams about DA progress and issues

#### 🗣️ Process 309 – Post-Mission Interview Between Mapper and QA/Dev  
**Owner:** Data Acquisition  
**Departments:** Data Acquisition, Development, QA  
**Category:** Quality & Control  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Some on-site issues are not visible in the data—they need to be spoken and shared.  

**Goal:**
Capture human insights immediately after upload.  

**How It Works:**

* Within 24h of data upload:
    - QA or Dev schedules a 10-minute chat or Loom
    - Asks:
    - “What did you notice that’s not in the files?”
    - “What would you change next time?”
* Notes stored in Session Feedback Log

**Benefits:**

* Captures nuance
* Improves next mission
* Builds cross-team understanding

#### 🔁 Process 9 – Always-On Project Timeline (Project History View)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Development, Executive, Marketing, PM, Sales  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 44  

**Goal:**
Give every project a structured visual timeline that tracks its evolution from kickoff to release.  

Actors Involved:  
PMs (curate the timeline), Devs/UX (flag changes), CEO/Stakeholders (review progress)  

**Tools:**

* Notion Timeline or FigJam board (embed into project doc)
* (Optional): Miro / Whimsical for design-oriented projects

🔧 How It Works:  

* A timeline board is created in the project Notion space (or embedded from FigJam)
* It visually records:
    - 📌 Key decisions (e.g., pivot, approval, shift in direction)
    - 🚧 Critical bug resolutions
    - ✅ Milestones reached (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Final)
    - 💡 Strategic moments (client feedback, internal review outcomes)
* Entries are brief, timestamped, and ideally linked to related tasks or documents.

Purpose:  

* Helps onboard new team members fast
* Offers transparent story for investor/client presentations
* Creates historical context for future planning or retrospectives

Frequency:  
Updated at every significant event or review point  
Reviewed weekly by PMs

#### 💬 Process 32 – Standard Project Closing Message (Celebration + Recap)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Forms, Loom, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Many projects end quietly, with no sense of closure, recognition, or documented final reflection.  
This weakens culture, motivation, and learning.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a standard project closing ritual that gives every release or delivery:  

* A proper wrap-up
* A visible announcement
* A moment to reflect and improve

**How It Works:**

1. When a project is officially closed:
    - PM or Owner records a short Loom Recap Video (1–3 minutes)

→ What was delivered, key challenges, major learnings  

2. Send a Slack message to a dedicated channel (e.g. #releases):

less  
CopyEdit  

🎉 Project [Project Name] has been officially closed!  

3. Here’s what’s included:
4. - 📄 Docs: [Notion link]
5. - 🎥 Loom Recap: [Loom link]
6. - 🗣️ Feedback Form: [Notion Form]
7. Thanks to everyone involved!
8. 

9. Trigger a Feedback Form:
    - Lightweight, async form with 3–5 questions:
    - What went well?
    - What didn’t work?
    - Any suggestions for the next project?

**Tools:**
Loom → Notion → Slack → Notion Form (or Typeform)  

**Benefits:**

* Gives closure and recognition
* Builds a learning loop for future projects
* Improves documentation quality
* Reinforces a strong, transparent culture

Project Managers are overwhelmed with execution, but leadership lacks a simple overview of strategic project status.  

**Goal:**
Create a high-level, executive-friendly board focused on project health and direction—not microtasks.  

**How It Works:**

1. A shared Asana board lists all strategic projects with:
    - 📊 Project Name
    - 🟢 Status: On Track / Slipping / Blocked
    - ⏳ % Completion
    - 👤 Owner
    - 📍 Next Key Milestone
2. PMs update the board twice per week
3. Tines sends a digest every Monday and Thursday to CEO, Leads, and Stakeholders via Slack or Email

**Tools:**
Asana (milestone-only board) + Tines automation  

**Benefits:**

* Clear strategic visibility
* Reduces the need for status calls
* Empowers decision-making without micromanagement

**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
If a key person disappears, gets sick, or resigns, projects stall and knowledge is lost.  

**Goal:**
Create a lightweight business continuity plan for every project—focused only on essentials.  

**How It Works:**

1. In each project’s Notion or ClickUp space, add a section called “📛 Emergency Access”
2. It includes:
    - 🔍 Current status (last update, current blocker, open questions)
    - 👥 Backup contacts / alternate owners
    - 📂 Where to find docs, code, credentials (links only)
    - 📆 Date of last review/update
3. PMs or leads are responsible for keeping this updated at each milestone or handover

**Tools:**
Notion embedded section → Template → Slack reminder every 60 days  

**Benefits:**

* Ensures continuity in case of absence
* Reduces risk of single-point failure
* Easy for others to step in when needed

**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** MeetGeek, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects involving multiple teams often begin with poor alignment, unclear ownership, and late-stage misunderstandings.  

**Goal:**
Establish a fast, visual kickoff format to align all teams before execution starts.  

**How It Works:**

1. For projects involving 2+ departments, kickoff includes:
    - A FigJam or Notion board visualizing:
    - Objectives
    - Flow/sequence
    - Owners per phase
    - Risks or open questions
2. A 30-minute kickoff call is held:

**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs manage too many projects across different statuses and don’t have a clear overview of what’s critical vs. on hold.  

**Goal:**
Give each PM a dashboard grouped by project priority & impact.  

**Structure:**

* 🟥 Critical → Client-facing or urgent launches
* 🟨 Active → Internal builds

**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, General, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs spend too much time manually updating stakeholders about milestone progress.  

**Goal:**
Automate key milestone communication without extra work.  

**How It Works:**

* Each milestone completion triggers a Tines flow:
    - For external: client email update
    - For internal: Slack update in #product / #client

**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Each team manages projects differently, which causes confusion, unclear ownership, and broken rituals.  

**Goal:**
Create a shared “how we operate” page per project, with basic rules and expectations set upfront.  

**How It Works:**

* At project kickoff, the PM creates a Notion page listing:
    - 📍 Official Slack channel
    - 👤 Who makes decisions (per area)
    - 📄 Where documentation lives
    - 🔁 Active rituals (weekly stand-up, Friday update, etc.)
* Each team member must read and acknowledge this page

**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** MeetGeek, Notion, Slack, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects end, but teams jump into the next one without reflecting on what worked and what didn’t.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a light, structured retrospective at the end of each mid-to-large project.  

**How It Works:**

* After every project longer than 2 weeks, the PM schedules:
    - A short live retro
    - Or an async form shared via Slack or Notion

    - ✅ What worked
    - ❌ What didn’t
    - ➡️ What we’ll do differently next time
* Linked to the project folder

Tools: Notion + Slack + MeetGeek (optional)  

**Benefits:**

* Preserves learning
* Avoids repeating mistakes
* Strengthens team alignment over time

#### 📊 Process 140 – Weekly Project Health Score  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Executive, PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Forms, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
There’s no ongoing visibility on how “healthy” a project is—not just in terms of delivery, but in clarity, morale, and risk.  

**Goal:**
Have each PM submit a weekly health check for their projects, which feeds into a dashboard.  

Scoring Criteria (1–5):  

* 🔍 Clarity (Do we know what to do?)
* 💬 Communication (Is everyone aligned?)
* ⚠️ Risk (Any blockers or red flags?)
* 🔥 Team Engagement (Are people present, motivated?)
* Data is visualized in Notion and flagged via Tines if scores drop

Tools: Tines + Notion Form + Notion  

**Benefits:**

* Early risk detection
* Weekly alignment
* Combines emotion + metrics

#### 🧱 Process 142 – Feasibility Window Response System  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, Hupsot, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** 141, 143  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients demand unrealistic delivery times, and teams don’t know how to reply without saying a flat “no.”  

**Goal:**
Build a transparent, option-based response framework for timing negotiation.  

**How It Works:**
For each client request, PM defines 3 timelines:  

* 🔴 Minimum time (if team drops everything)
* 🟡 Focused time (with priority shift)
* 🟢 Realistic time (within roadmap)

The client receives all 3 options, with trade-offs noted (quality, roadmap impact).  
Tools: Slack / Email / HubSpot templates  

**Benefits:**

* Builds client trust
* Gives PM leverage
* Protects roadmap and internal balance

#### 🗓️ Process 143 – Client Calendar with Reasoned Shifts  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** 141, 142  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients get upset when timelines change—but often, they don't see the internal logic or alternatives.  

**Goal:**
Keep clients aligned and proactive by sharing a mini calendar view of project health and timing.  

**How It Works:**

* PM shares a simplified calendar (PDF or Notion page) with:
    - Milestones
    - Current risk areas
    - Alternative delivery proposals

(e.g., deliver Phase 1 now, Phase 2 in 10 days)  

* Calendar is updated weekly and accessible in read-only format

**Benefits:**

* Demonstrates transparency
* Eases frustration during delays
* Makes PMs more credible in front of clients

#### 📉 Process 144 – “Backfire Sheet” for Risky Deliveries  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, Email, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Sometimes, clients insist on a release date even when the team knows it’s rushed or incomplete.  

**Goal:**
Document the consequences of accepting premature delivery so the risk is visible to everyone—including the client.  

**How It Works:**

* When a risky deadline is accepted, PM fills a Backfire Sheet:
    - What corners are being cut?
    - Is QA reduced?
    - Is documentation incomplete?
    - What might go wrong?
* Sheet is saved in the project folder and optionally shared with the client

Tools: Notion template  

**Benefits:**

* Makes trade-offs explicit
* Protects team in case of post-launch issues
* Useful for negotiation and accountability

**Category:** Communication, Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Signature Tools  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Unspoken client expectations cause friction later—especially around response times, scope, or revision rounds.  

**Goal:**
Set explicit boundaries and shared commitments at project start.  

**How It Works:**

* PM prepares a document outlining:
    - 🕒 Response times
    - 🔁 Revision limits
    - 📅 Project phases

**Departments:** PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication, Other  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, Hupsot, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Saying “yes” to everything creates chaos; saying “no” creates tension.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a structured way to say “no” constructively.  

**How It Works:**
For each impossible request, the response follows 3 parts:  

* ❌ No: "That won’t be feasible as requested..."
* ✅ But: "We can offer an alternative that’s more sustainable..."
* 📅 When: "And we could deliver it by [realistic date]"

Templates are used in Slack, Email, or HubSpot  

**Benefits:**

* Protects team
* Maintains client relationship
* Builds negotiation skillset internally

**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Internal teams don’t know how much of their time is diverted by client-specific requests.  

**Goal:**
Track the cost of accepted client work on internal delivery.  

**How It Works:**

* Every accepted client request is tagged as CUSTOM-CLIENT
* Linked to an internal task it affects
* Tines logs:
    - Days delayed
    - Tasks postponed or shifted
    - Teams involved
* A monthly report shows "client impact cost" → used in client review or planning

**Benefits:**

* Makes roadmap trade-offs visible
* Supports prioritization discussions
* Creates negotiating leverage

**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Email, MeetGeek, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
High-pressure or confusing client calls often end with verbal commitments no one remembers—or misinterprets.  

**Goal:**
Create a short written recap after unclear or critical calls, shared and archived.  

**How It Works:**

* After the call, PM creates a 3-point memo:
    - What was actually requested?
    - What was explicitly agreed upon?
    - What requires internal alignment?
* Memo is sent to the client for confirmation + saved in project folder

Tools: MeetGeek + Notion or PDF export  

**Benefits:**

* Reduces misalignment
* Protects both sides
* Documents the “real story” of complex interactions

**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Internal teams don’t know which client requests were accepted, declined, or why.  

**Goal:**
Create a shared internal dashboard of client request outcomes.  

**How It Works:**

* PM maintains a Notion page called Client Request Tracker
* Each entry shows:
    - ✅ Accepted – in progress
    - ⏳ Under review
    - ❌ Declined – with reasoning
* Dashboard is visible to Dev, UX, Marketing, and updated weekly

**Benefits:**

* Improves cross-team transparency

#### 🤝 Process 151 – “Project Alliance” Between PM and Department Leads  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, PM  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Project Managers often request information or commitment from department leads but receive vague, incomplete, or delayed responses—especially when there's no agreed way of working together.  

**Goal:**
Establish a lightweight but clear operational agreement between the PM and all involved team leads before each execution phase begins. This ensures shared ownership and expectations from day one.  

🔧 How It Works:  

1. At the start of each project (before active development begins), the PM creates a shared page in Notion titled “Project Alliance”.
2. The page outlines:
    - 🔹 Key roles and responsibilities per team
    - 💬 Preferred communication method (Slack thread, async form, or short check-ins)
    - 📆 Intermediate deadlines and key checkpoints
    - 🔄 How updates and escalation will be handled
3. Each involved lead (Dev, UX, QA, Sales, etc.) reviews and agrees on the content.
4. The agreement is approved informally via:
    - Slack reaction (✅)
    - Short comment
    - Optional email confirmation
5. The “Project Alliance” is:
    - Pinned in the Notion project folder
    - Shared in the main Slack project channel for visibility

📎 Example Use Case:  
A project involving Dev, UX, and QA:  

* Dev agrees to respond within 24h to blockers
* UX agrees to complete revisions before the start of implementation
* QA agrees to send test coverage plans before delivery reviews
* The PM agrees to summarize status every Friday and flag risks via Slack

**Tools:**
Notion (Project Alliance template) + Slack thread + optional Slack reminder via Tines  

**Benefits:**

* Clear expectations before execution
* Fewer miscommunications during delivery
* Stronger sense of partnership and accountability
* Easy to refer back if conflicts arise

**Category:** Communication, Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Forms, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs waste time chasing fragmented inputs from each department. Everyone provides different levels of detail, in different formats, at different times.  

**Goal:**
Create a standardized checklist per department that team leads must fill out for each new project before execution begins.  

**How It Works:**

* A structured checklist is prepared for each function (Notion form, Notion Form, or ClickUp form):
    - Dev: Required time, technical risks, dependencies, resource availability
    - UX: Figma status, number of revisions planned, expected handoff date
    - QA: Key risk zones, configuration needs, testing tools, and test window
* The PM shares the form with team leads during the project setup phase
* The completed checklists are:
    - Saved in the shared Notion project space
    - Visible to CEO and PMO for transparency
    - Reviewed before assigning timelines or deliverables

**Tools:**
ClickUp Form or Notion DB + Slack notification  

**Benefits:**

* Predictable inputs from all teams
* Fast scoping with fewer assumptions
* CEO and PMO have visibility from the start

#### 🗣️ Process 153 – Focused Check-in Calls Only Between PM and Team Leads  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Team Leads & Managers  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, MeetGeek, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Project meetings include too many people, waste time, and blur decision-making. PMs get feedback from team members without strategic context.  

**Goal:**
Limit operational and planning conversations to PM + Department Leads only—in short, high-signal check-ins.  

**How It Works:**

* PM schedules 15-minute alignment calls with:
    - Dev Lead
    - UX Lead
    - QA Lead
    - Other relevant leads
* These check-ins:
    - Replace broad team calls
    - Focus on risks, dependencies, and upcoming deliverables
    - Are recorded via MeetGeek if others need to listen later
* Leads collect feedback from their teams and report insights

**Tools:**
Google Calendar + MeetGeek + Slack follow-up  

**Benefits:**

* Tighter, faster sync
* Less interruption for operational teams
* Information flows through leadership, not noise

#### 🧠 Process 158 – Private Project Slack Channels with Focused Access  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
When everyone is in the same Slack project channel, things get noisy, diluted, and hard to track.  

**Goal:**
Create private project Slack channels that include only PM + key department leads.  

**How It Works:**

* For every active project:
    - A Slack channel is created: #proj-[name]-pm-devlead-uxlead
* The channel is used for:
    - High-level strategy
    - Status updates
    - Decisions and documentation links
* Broader team updates are shared weekly in public product channels

**Benefits:**

* Reduces information noise
* Clear thread of decisions
* Protects operational team focus

#### 📝 Process 160 – Co-Signed Document Before Execution Phase  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Teams often begin execution without shared clarity on goals, responsibilities, and what “done” means.  

**Goal:**
Require a jointly signed agreement between the PM and each department lead before starting any execution phase.  

**How It Works:**

* Before execution begins, the PM prepares a “Phase Agreement” in Notion:
    - 🎯 Objectives
    - ✅ What defines completion
    - 👤 Owner per deliverable
    - ⚠️ Known risks or blockers
    - 📆 Key timing and checkpoints
* Each team lead adds a comment or emoji to confirm
* Link is shared in the project Slack thread
* Stored in the Notion project folder

**Benefits:**

* Eliminates ambiguity
* Creates shared accountability
* Helps PM manage follow-ups with clarity

#### 🔍 Process 164 – “In Scope / Out of Scope” Table (Publicly Visible)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Deployment & Delivery, Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients request changes or additions that were never part of the agreement—creating conflict.  

**Goal:**
Maintain a side-by-side scope visibility document, accessible to internal teams and clients.  

**How It Works:**

* The PM creates a 2-column table:
    - ✅ In Scope: listed deliverables and commitments
    - ❌ Out of Scope: anything explicitly excluded or not agreed upon
* Shared at project kickoff and updated if anything changes
* Linked in the project folder and optionally embedded in the contract

Tools: Notion Table or PDF  

**Benefits:**

* Prevents scope creep
* Quick reference for Sales and PMs
* Avoids “but I thought it was included” discussions

#### 📝 Process 167 – Change of Scope Protocol  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Deployment & Delivery  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients request changes mid-project, and the team implements them informally—causing chaos.  

**Goal:**
Standardize how changes after contract signature are requested, evaluated, and approved.  

**How It Works:**

1. The client submits a Change Request form
2. PM evaluates:
    - Technical impact
    - Timeline
    - Cost or delivery change
3. If accepted:
    - A formal Contract Addendum is generated
    - Signed and stored with the original agreement
    - Work only begins after sign-off

Tools: Notion Form + Addendum PDF template + Slack notifications  

**Benefits:**

* Full control of mid-project changes
* Legal compliance
* Budget and delivery integrity

**Tools:** ClickUp, Loom, NAS & Drive, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Project documents remain scattered across Notion, ClickUp, Slack, Loom, and Drive.  

**Goal:**
At the end of each project, create a formal closure and archiving process.  

PM is responsible for:  

* Moving final docs into the NAS
* Renaming files to match naming conventions
* Creating a README_PROJECT.txt with:
    - Overview
    - Final status
    - Project owner
    - Link to external tools (Notion, ClickUp, Loom)
    - Optional: summary of lessons learned
* Checklist is added to ClickUp → marked complete only when archiving is done

**Benefits:**

* Proper project closure
* Easier access later (support, upgrades, investor reviews)
* Clear historical traceability

**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Clients request files casually via email → risk of sending outdated or unauthorized content.  

**Goal:**
Set up a secure read-only client folder on the NAS.  

**How It Works:**

* Each client has a personal read-only folder
* Contents:
    - Only files approved by PM
    - Optional: NDA, signed scope, release files
* Shared via:
    - Temporary link
    - VPN access
    - Optional digital signature required before download

Managed by PM or Admin Team  

**Benefits:**

* Reduced data risk

#### 📌 Process 195 – Mandatory Document Owner Assignment at Project Start  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects start with no one clearly assigned to maintain the documents that will be produced.  

**Goal:**
Make it mandatory to assign document owners during the project kickoff phase.  

**How It Works:**

* In the project setup checklist (Notion/ClickUp), include a field:
    - “Assign Document Owners by area” → Dev, Legal, UX, QA, etc.
* The project cannot proceed without this step completed
* A Slack ping via Tines notifies the PM if this field is missing

Tools: Notion project template + Slack + Tines  

**Benefits:**

* Enforces documentation responsibility
* Prevents ownership gaps mid-project
* Ensures files have clear custodians

**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** Project-Related  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Projects are sometimes isolated from long-term business goals.  

**Goal:**
Ensure every project clearly aligns with at least one strategic company objective.  

**How It Works:**

* Each project has a Notion section:

🎯 Alignment with Company Strategy  

* PM links the project to:
    - Quarterly/Annual OKRs
    - Key business priorities
* PM updates alignment status monthly in the Notion dashboard

**Benefits:**

* Avoids disconnected efforts
* Helps CEO monitor ROI by initiative
* Guides focus for all involved teams

#### 🧭 Process 23 – 3-Layer Product Map (Core / Experimental / Custom)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy, Team Sync  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** Asana, ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** 11  

**Context & Problem:**
Product teams and stakeholders often confuse strategic features with one-off client requests.  
The roadmap becomes a mess.  

**Goal:**
Visually and structurally separate product development into three clear tracks to help everyone understand what’s core, what’s a test, and what’s custom.  

**How It Works:**

1. Create a “Product Map” page in Notion (or board in ClickUp)

Split features into three labeled categories:  

    - 🔵 Core – Long-term, strategic, foundational parts of the platform

(e.g., authentication, CMS core, navigation engine)  

    - 🟠 Experimental – Tests, MVPs, innovation pieces being validated

(e.g., SmartParking AI add-on, new AR interface)  

    - 🟢 Custom – One-off or client-specific features not meant for the general product

(e.g., museum-specific integration, white-labeled UI)  

2. Each feature includes:
    - Owner
    - Link to design/spec
    - % progress
    - Delivery date
3. Updated weekly by PMs or Tech Leads

Used in all product reviews and planning  

**Tools:**
ClickUp (with tags/labels) → Notion (for visual product map)  

**Benefits:**

* Helps prioritize correctly
* Improves transparency with clients
* Shows product maturity and innovation areas

#### 📥 Process 36 – Unified “Release Review” Channel  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, Marketing  
**Category:** Communication, Deployment & Delivery, Team Sync  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Loom, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Once a feature or fix goes live, many team members—including Sales, UX, QA, and even other Devs—don’t know what was released.  
This causes misalignment, missed training opportunities, and lack of product ownership.  

**Goal:**
Create a central Slack channel where every release is shared, reviewed, and open to comments across departments.  

**How It Works:**

1. Channel Setup:
    - Slack channel: #release-review
    - Visible to all departments
2. For every release (even small):
    - Dev or PM posts:
    - 🆕 What was released
    - 📂 Related tasks (ClickUp link)
    - 🧪 Notes if anything still needs to be tested
    - 🎥 Optional Loom with walkthrough or visual changes
3. Cross-Team Comments Welcome:
    - Anyone can comment with:
    - Questions
    - Feedback
    - Suggestions
    - Praise
4. Optional Weekly Digest:
    - Tines/Slackbot compiles all entries into a Monday digest

**Tools:**
Slack → Loom (optional) → ClickUp task links → Tines (digest automation)  

**Benefits:**

* Builds shared product awareness
* Encourages constructive, asynchronous feedback
* Reduces silos between Dev, UX, Marketing, QA, Sales
* Makes quality part of company culture, not just code

#### 🧰 Process 37 – Minimum Release Package Template  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development  
**Category:** Communication, Documentation  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Loom, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Every team or release owner tends to manage handoffs differently.  
As a result, some features go live:  

* Without QA validation
* With outdated documentation
* Without internal announcement or assets for marketing

This inconsistency creates confusion, bugs, and missed opportunities.  

**Goal:**
Define a minimum set of deliverables that must be completed before closing any release—ensuring quality, alignment, and readiness across departments.  

* What the Template Includes

Every release (even minor) must check off the following items:  

1. Task Completed
    - All subtasks and linked items are resolved in ClickUp
2. QA Passed
    - Bug log reviewed
    - Critical issues resolved and retested
3. Loom Video Created
    - Short walkthrough explaining: what was built, how it works, and where to find it
    - Used by team members, Sales, and Marketing
4. Figma Updated
    - UI reflects final state
    - Design tokens, components, and states are cleaned and archived
5. Documentation Saved
    - Feature added to Notion with:
    - Description
    - Owner
    - Release notes
    - Known limitations
6. Marketing Notified
    - Feature is added to the Go-To-Market sync
    - Visual and messaging needs confirmed
    - If public: timeline agreed with Marketing

**How It Works:**

* The template is integrated into ClickUp or Tines
* Each release card includes a “Release Checklist” subtask or automation
* Tines can prevent a release task from being marked complete unless all boxes are checked

**Tools:**
ClickUp checklist or form → Notion → Loom → Slack (for marketing sync)  
Optional: Tines blocker automation  

**Benefits:**

* Guarantees release consistency
* Reduces chaos for QA, Marketing, and Sales
* Ensures traceability and internal understanding
* Scales as you grow with minimal overhead

#### 💼 Process 42 – Sales: Early Product Access Tracker  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Development, Marketing, PM, Sales  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** Loom, Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Sales often learns about new features after they're released—missing early demo opportunities.  

**Goal:**
Give Sales early visibility on internal features in final QA phase, so they can prepare and pitch in time.  

**How It Works:**

1. When a feature is entering final QA, PM or Dev Lead adds it to a Notion page called “Early Access Products”
2. The entry includes:
    - Feature name and owner
    - Pitch summary (1-liner)
    - Demo Loom (optional)
    - Value proposition
    - Ready-to-share deck
    - Expected release date
3. Slack #sales-drop channel posts each new entry
    - Sales can book internal demo or note potential leads

**Tools:**
Notion → Slack → Loom (optional) → Pitch Deck (PDF)  

**Benefits:**

* Sales is ready before launch
* Faster GTM execution
* Feature value is communicated clearly and on time

#### 📘 Process 70 – Internal Wiki: Product Pages Like Landing Pages  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, Executive, Marketing, Sales  
**Category:** Communication, Team Sync  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** Figma, GitLab, Loom, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Marketing and Sales don’t always know how to position a product. UX team lacks a reference for voice, story, and purpose.  

**Goal:**
Create an internal wiki page for each product/module, styled like a mini landing page.  

**How It Works:**

1. Each product gets a dedicated Notion page with:
    - 🏷 Name
    - 💬 Pitch sentence
    - 📸 Screenshots or Figma links
    - 🧩 Key Features
    - 👥 Target Buyer Persona
    - 📈 Current status: dev / test / live
    - 🔗 Link to GitHub, ClickUp, and Loom
2. Page is accessible to all: Sales, Marketing, UX, PM

**Tools:**
Notion + Figma + Loom + GitHub → Linked together  

**Benefits:**

* Marketing writes faster, with better info
* Sales knows what to sell and how
* Design and PM stay aligned on purpose and tone

#### 📘 Process 157 – Knowledge Handoff from Team Leads to PM  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Design, Development, PM  
**Category:** Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
PMs often lack the technical or UX background to write complete briefs on their own.  

**Goal:**
Require knowledge transfer sessions from each team lead to the PM before planning starts.  

**How It Works:**

* Each team lead shares:
    - 🛠 Dev: technical logic, backend requirements
    - 🎨 UX: design reasoning, edge cases
    - 🧪 QA: fragile zones, known failure patterns
* The knowledge is shared via:
    - Loom
    - Short Notion doc
    - Slack message + links
* The PM uses this input to create:
    - Internal roadmap brief
    - External client-facing proposal

**Benefits:**

* Stronger, well-structured brief
* Less revision or misalignment during delivery
* Promotes PM autonomy

#### 📘 804 – Annual CEO Decision Archive (Managed Only by PMO)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** CEO, PM  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** Product-Related  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
The CEO needs access to strategic memory without managing documentation.  

**Goal:**
Maintain a quarterly-updated, yearly file of all strategic decisions and results.  

**Structure:**

* 📅 Yearly PDF
* 📝 Each entry: decision, owner, result, impact
* 🔖 Tags: Department / Priority / Project

#### •           3-person meeting (Sales + PM + CTO/Delivery Lead)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

* ClickUp task: “Project Received” → assigned to PM

📁 Tracked in: Handoff_Log.csv + PM signature required

#### 🎯 Process 4 – Assign a Clear Owner to Every Module or Function  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Goal:**
Avoid ambiguity and delays by assigning a single operational Owner to each project area—no shared responsibility, no confusion.  

Actors Involved:  

* Owner: Can be a Developer, UX, PM, or Salesperson, depending on the topic
* Project Manager: Ensures that every task/module has an Owner assigned and tracked
* Team Leads: Support the Owner but do not replace them

**Tools:**

* ClickUp → Custom field called Owner for every task, feature, or deliverable
* Notion → Mirrors ownership in each module section (auto-synced or manual link)
* (Optional): Slackbot / Tines can alert when tasks lack an Owner or if inactivity is detected

🔧 How It Works:  

1. At Kickoff or Sprint Planning:

Every task, module (e.g., frontend UI, backend API, robotic unit, image recognition), or external delivery must have a named Owner.  

2. In ClickUp:

Use the Owner custom field for each card/task → shows up in task views, dashboards, and reports.  

3. In Notion:

Within each section of a project (e.g., “UX”, “Backend”, “Delivery to Client”), list the Owner name visibly. Add a profile link for reference.  

4. Responsibilities of the Owner:
    - ✅ Track and push forward the execution (progress, blockers, timelines)
    - ✅ Communicate status updates in stand-ups, handovers, and weekly PM syncs
    - ✅ Update relevant documentation (Notion, Confluence, NAS folders)
    - ✅ Coordinate with others, but they remain the reference person at all times
5. If the Owner Changes:

It must be updated both in ClickUp and Notion, with handover notes written or recorded (e.g., Loom).  

Frequency:  

* Must be set for every item before work starts
* Reviewed weekly by PMs or during sprint retros

**Benefits:**

* No more diluted responsibility
* Clear point of contact for any topic
* Enables async clarity, especially cross-timezone
* Supports traceability during audits, handovers, or board reviews

#### ⏰ Process 5 – Daily Fixed Time Slots for Cross-Timezone Sync  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, MeetGeek, Zoom & Meets  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Goal:**
Establish a consistent daily window for real-time communication across timezones, ensuring alignment, velocity, and full team accountability.  

Actors Involved:  
All departments: Dev, PM, UX/UI, Sales, Marketing, Legal, Admin, Support, Field Ops  

**Tools:**

* Google Calendar – recurring blocks, visible to all
* Google Meet / Zoom – pre-attached to each slot
* (Optional): MeetGeek for automatic call summaries

🔧 How It Works:  

1. Fixed Overlap Window:

Every weekday (Monday to Friday), from:  
17:00–19:00 CET / 8:00–10:00 PT  

2. Daily Block Structure:

This window is reserved exclusively for:  

    - Quick alignments between Italy ↔ US
    - Issue resolution and unblockings
    - Strategic updates from CEO/PMs
    - Team-specific check-ins or releases
3. Team Scheduling:

Each department (Dev, UX, PM, etc.) has at least one mandatory call per week within this window, pre-scheduled in the shared calendar.  

Additional calls (if needed) can happen within the same window, but require at least 24 hours notice to allow for teams to prepare, and allow for work-from-home if necessary.  

4. Participation is Mandatory:
    - “Being present” is not enough
    - Everyone must actively contribute, with updates, questions, or decisions
    - Camera-on is strongly encouraged (unless specified otherwise)
5. An agenda must be shared before each meeting, and contributed to by all attendees:

All other communication (outside this slot) remains asynchronous: Notion, ClickUp, Slack.  

6. Async Before/After:

All other communication (outside this slot) remains asynchronous: Notion, ClickUp, Slack.  

Frequency:  
🗓 Daily (Monday–Friday)  

📍 Department-specific calls: at least 1× per week  
📌 Managed via shared Google Calendar + automated reminders  

**Benefits:**

* Guarantees rhythm and face-to-face alignment
* Reduces timezone friction
* Builds accountability and team culture
* Prevents execution delays and misunderstandings

#### 🧘 Process 16 – Monthly Strategic Reset Day  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** 33  

**Context & Problem:**
High-speed execution leads to technical debt, messy docs, and mental fatigue. Teams rarely get time to clean, rethink, or organize.  

**Goal:**
Once a month, give everyone protected time to step back, reorganize, and clear operational clutter.  

**How It Works:**

* Block ½ day per month in the shared calendar
* No meetings, no deadlines, no releases
* Activities include:
    - Cleaning old tasks
    - Updating docs
    - Organizing Figma files
    - Archiving things no longer relevant

**Tools:**
ClickUp, Figma, Notion → calendar block  

**Benefits:**

* Improves long-term quality
* Reduces confusion and clutter
* Boosts morale and focus

#### 🔄 Process 22 – Quarterly Mini-OKRs for Every Team  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Teams often focus on their own “busywork,” without alignment on what truly matters for the company right now.  

**Goal:**
Every team defines 3 clear operational priorities (Mini-OKRs) per quarter, aligned with company goals—without making it bureaucratic.  

**How It Works:**

1. Each team (Dev, UX, Marketing, Sales, PM):
    - Defines 3 Mini-Objectives with 1–2 Key Results each
    - These should be:
    - Specific, visible
    - Achievable within the quarter
    - Tied to product, growth, or quality goals
2. No bonus or financial pressure:
    - These OKRs are for clarity, not control
    - Used during sprint planning and retrospectives for focus and reporting
3. Review:
    - Reviewed by the CEO or a PM delegate
    - Updated in Notion or Asana OKR tracker
    - Shared with the full company for transparency

**Tools:**
Notion / Asana  

**Benefits:**

* Creates alignment across departments
* Helps cut noise and focus on real impact
* Promotes team visibility without micromanagement

#### 🎓 Process 24 – Weekly Internal Teaching Slot (Rotating Knowledge Sharing)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Other, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Google Calendar, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Team members often know what tools we use (Notion, Git, Figma...), but not how to master them.  
Expertise stays trapped in silos.  

**Goal:**
Create a low-pressure, recurring internal learning moment, where team members teach each other practical things that elevate everyone.  

**How It Works:**

1. Once a month, a different team member hosts a 1-hour session
    - Can be live or recorded via Loom
    - Format is open: demo, explanation, workflow walk-through
2. Topics can include:
    - How to prepare a dev PR properly
    - Design tokens and Figma libraries
    - How to structure ClickUp tasks
    - Building a dashboard in Notion
    - How to plan GTM strategies or read analytics
3. Participation:
    - Everyone is encouraged to attend, ask questions
    - Recordings are stored in a Notion "Knowledge Library"
4. PM or Ops person curates calendar + reminders

**Tools:**
Google Calendar → Loom / Zoom → Notion (for archive)  

**Benefits:**

* Spreads internal knowledge
* Increases tool mastery
* Builds culture of excellence and teaching
* Promotes cross-role empathy

#### 📉 Process 25 – FAILLOG: Documenting Mistakes to Avoid Repetition  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Documentation, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** 12  

**Context & Problem:**
When bugs, design errors, or wrong decisions occur, they’re often discussed briefly and forgotten.  
The result? Teams repeat the same mistakes—losing time and credibility.  

**Goal:**
Create a lightweight, team-editable log to document what didn’t work, what was learned, and how to avoid it next time.  

**How It Works:**

* For every project, create a file called faillog.md (or a Notion page titled “Fails & Fixes”)
* Anyone on the team can add entries after releases, sprints, or post-mortems
* Each entry includes:
    - ❌ What didn’t work
    - 💡 What we learned
    - 🛠 How to prevent this in the future
* The tone is constructive, not accusatory.
* The log is accessible to everyone, including new joiners.

**Tools:**
GitHub Wiki or Notion  
(Optional: link from milestone task in ClickUp)  

**Benefits:**

* Promotes continuous learning
* Prevents knowledge loss
* Builds operational maturity over time

#### ⚙️ Process 28 – “What’s Blocking Us?” → Transparent Escalation System  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Communication, Deployment & Delivery  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Many blockers aren’t reported until it's too late to act without delay or rework.  

**Goal:**
Build a lightweight, transparent system to flag blockers early—without blame, and without requiring a meeting.  

**How It Works:**

* Every ClickUp task includes a required field: Blocked: Yes / No
* If marked Yes, Tines triggers an automatic alert with:
    - 🔗 Task title and link
    - 👤 Person responsible
    - ✏️ 2-line description of the blocker
* Alerts go to:
    - Project Manager
    - Team lead or tech owner
    - Optional: Slack channel like #blocked or #ops
* Once a week, a digest of active blockers is sent out and reviewed.

**Tools:**
ClickUp → Tines → Slack Digest (optional)  

**Benefits:**

* Makes obstacles visible early
* Clarifies responsibility
* Creates shared ownership for solving problems

#### 🪪 Process 30 – “Topic Owners” (Not Just Project Owners)  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Some critical areas (e.g., accessibility, frontend performance, documentation quality) don’t fall under any specific project—but still need care.  

**Goal:**
Assign clear ownership of important cross-functional themes that affect product quality long-term.  

**How It Works:**

1. Define cross-project “topics” such as:
    - UX consistency
    - Documentation quality
    - Component library maintenance
    - Performance / speed
    - Testing standards
    - Accessibility
2. Assign a Topic Owner for each one:
    - Doesn’t require full-time work
    - Person is the go-to reference and quality gate
    - Can suggest improvements, propose standards, or flag risks
3. Maintain a “Topic Ownership Map” in Notion with:
    - Topic name
    - Owner
    - Scope and related responsibilities
    - Related project connections
4. Provide a Starter Kit for new Topic Owners including:
    - Scope
    - Tools
    - Expectations

**Benefits:**

* Ensures neglected areas are cared for
* Distributes accountability
* Creates internal champions for quality and culture

#### 👣 Process 34 – Follow-Up Structure for "Not Now" Ideas  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** Executive, General, PM  
**Category:** Planning & Strategy, Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
During planning, calls, or execution, high-value ideas often emerge—but if they’re not immediately actionable, they get lost or forgotten.  
They disappear into Slack threads, mental notes, or are replaced by more urgent tasks.  

**Goal:**
Create a structured system to preserve, revisit, and activate ideas that are valuable, but not urgent.  

**How It Works:**

1. Every idea that’s “not for now” is added to a “Later” section
    - A shared Notion space or ClickUp list called: 📂 Incubation / Later Ideas
    - Each entry includes:
    - Short description of the idea
    - Why it matters
    - Status: “to revisit”, “needs validation”, “pending alignment”
    - Suggested timeframe or trigger condition
2. Temporary Owner Assigned:
    - Usually the person closest to the idea: Lead Dev, UX Lead, PM
    - Their job is only to ensure the idea is kept alive—not to execute it now
3. Monthly Ritual:
    - On the last Friday of every month, the CEO or PM hosts a 15–30 min async or live review
    - Ideas are evaluated: archive, promote, or keep in incubation

**Tools:**
Notion board or ClickUp list → Slack reminders  

**Benefits:**

* Protects strategic thinking from being lost in urgency
* Creates a backlog of innovation opportunities
* Enables better long-term planning and roadmap development

**Goal:**
Record all key meetings and tag topics and highlights for fast review and future access.  

**How It Works:**

* Weekly reviews, retrospectives, CEO briefings, and demos are recorded via Loom or Google Meet
* After the meeting, meeting organnizers add:
    - Tags: e.g., “UX Decision”, “Timeline Change”, “Tech Debt”
    - Timestamped summary in Notion
* Each recording is saved under the relevant project or in a shared “Meeting Archive”

**Tools:**
Loom or Google Meet → Notion  

**Benefits:**

**Context & Problem:**
Even when meetings are productive, the resulting actions are often lost, untracked, or unclear.  

**Goal:**
Automatically extract tasks and assign them after every recorded meeting.  

**How It Works:**

1. Meeting is recorded with MeetGeek
2. MeetGeek transcribes and summarizes the meeting
3. Tines reads the transcript → detects action points and creates:
    - Task in ClickUp
    - Assigned Owner
    - Due date
    - Link to transcript snippet
4. Team lead quickly reviews and approves task list

**Tools:**
MeetGeek → Tines → ClickUp

**Category:** Planning & Strategy  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, MeetGeek, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 17, 20, 61, 63  

**Context & Problem:**
The CEO’s time in meetings is valuable—but often diluted by vague discussions or unclear outcomes.  

**Goal:**
Maximize the impact of CEO involvement by structuring and tagging meetings intelligently.  

**How It Works:**

1. Any meeting involving the CEO is:
    - Recorded
    - Transcribed and tagged (MeetGeek)
2. Action points triggered by the CEO become:
    - Tasks in ClickUp
    - Assigned with due dates
    - Linked to transcript highlight
3. Summary is shared only with operational teams

**Tools:**
MeetGeek → Tines → ClickUp  

**Benefits:**

**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Daily ops leave no space for innovation. Great ideas die in the backlog.  

**Goal:**
Create a recurring, protected space for team-driven innovation, experimentation, and naming.

#### 🔗 Process 78 – "Point of Truth" per Area  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Team Sync  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
With too many tools and versions, no one knows which data is reliable.  
Different teams use different sources for the same thing.  

**Goal:**
Establish a single source of truth for each company domain.  
“If it’s not there, it’s not real.”  

**How It Works:**

1. Define one platform or space per department:
    - 📈 Sales → HubSpot
    - 🛠 Dev roadmap → ClickUp
    - 🎨 Design system → Figma library
    - 🧠 Strategy → Notion master page
2. Create a Notion page: Company Points of Truth
    - Lists each department
    - Links the official tool
    - Names the person responsible for updates

**Benefits:**

* Cuts confusion
* Aligns teams on a shared version of reality
* Encourages documentation discipline

**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** ClickUp, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
As CEO or Team Lead, you need a quick view to know who needs support or recognition.  

**Goal:**
Build a real-time, at-a-glance dashboard per person and per team.  

**Includes:**

* Weekly task output (ClickUp)
* QA score (bugs, rework, incidents)
* Cross-team participation
* Highlighted reports (positive or critical)

**Tools:**
ClickUp + Notion + Slack + Tines  

**Benefits:**

* 30-second insight per person
* Proactive leadership

#### 🎥 Process 137 – Bimonthly Progress Loom from PMs  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Other  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
It’s hard for the CEO, leads, and stakeholders to get a visual sense of how a project is evolving—especially when updates are buried in text or tasks.  

**Goal:**
Create short, regular, visual progress reports that bring clarity and visibility to strategic initiatives.  

**How It Works:**

* Every 2 weeks, the PM records a 3-minute Loom video covering:
    - What was done since the last update
    - What's coming next
    - Current risks, blockers, or support needed
* The Loom is saved in the project folder and shared with:
    - CEO
    - Leadership
    - Investors (if applicable)

Tools: Loom + Notion folder  

**Benefits:**

* Gives context beyond checklists
* Scales communication across teams
* Improves stakeholder trust and alignment

#### 📢 Process 156 – Flash Updates Between Departments and PM  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General, PM  
**Category:** Communication  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Strategic updates or risks from teams don’t reach the PM in time, leading to bad assumptions or late reactions.  

**Goal:**
Establish a short weekly ritual where each department shares one quick update with the PM.  

**How It Works:**

* Every Wednesday or Friday, each team lead sends a 1-paragraph update via:
    - Slack
    - Voice message
    - Short written Loom if needed
* Topics include:
    - Delivery status
    - Risks
    - Important decisions or client input
* Tines logs updates into a “PM Weekly Summary” database

**Tools:**
Slack + Notion (auto-logged via Tines)  

**Benefits:**

* Short, async alignment
* No meetings required
* Continuous awareness without micromanagement

#### 📍 Process 159 – Mandatory Read Confirmation for Strategic Info  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** General  
**Category:** Ownership & Accountability  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
When PMs share specs or decisions, they don’t know if leads have read them—causing risk of silent misalignment.  

**Goal:**
Introduce a standard “confirmation of receipt” ritual for critical communications.  

**How It Works:**

* Every key piece of info (Slack, task, Notion doc) includes a note:
    - “Please confirm by reacting ✅ or commenting 'Read'”
* Tines tracks interactions:
    - If no reply within 48h → Slack reminder
    - Optionally, tag the department lead and PMO

**Tools:**
Slack + Tines tracking  

**Benefits:**

* Traceable acknowledgment
* Enforces accountability
* Avoids “I missed that” errors

**Departments:** HR  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion, Slack, Tines  
**Related Process IDs:** 183, 193, 194  

**Context & Problem:**
Important documents go untouched for months or years because nobody is responsible for reviewing them.  

**Goal:**
Assign a Review Owner and automate reminders for regular updates.  

**How It Works:**

* Every strategic document has:
    - 📋 Review Owner
    - 📅 Next Review Date
* Tines sends a Slack/Email alert:
    - If the review is overdue
    - Or to confirm the document is still valid

**Benefits:**

* Maintains content health
* Prevents silent drift
* Easy to distribute responsibility

**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM, Team Leads & Managers  
**Category:** Documentation  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** NAS & Drive, Notion  
**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Strategic projects often lack a ready-to-use documentation set for investors, due diligence, or external partners.  

**Goal:**
Ensure every strategic project maintains an Audit Ready Folder for external visibility when needed.  

**How It Works:**

* For each strategic initiative, the PM creates an Audit Ready Folder containing:
    - 📝 Executive summary (project pitch in <1 page)
    - ✅ Completed milestones
    - 🐞 Key bug reports + resolution logs
    - 📄 Signed contracts, SoWs, and client-approved release forms
* Folder is stored on the NAS and linked to a Notion index
* Access limited to CEO, Legal, and external parties (only upon request)

**Benefits:**

* Instant readiness for due diligence
* Confidence for investors or partners
* Easier M&A and board-level conversations

#### 🧾 Process 216 – “Decision Timeout” Policy with Implied Approval  
**Owner:** PM  
**Departments:** PM  
**Category:** Quality & Control  
**Type:** General Process  
**Tools:** General  
**Related Process IDs:** 214, 215, 219, 220  

**Context & Problem:**
Decisions (UX, naming, features) are blocked for days because the client never replies.  

**Goal:**
Set a fixed timeout window after which silence = implicit approval.  

**How It Works:**

* PM notifies the client:
    - “You have 3–5 working days to respond. After this, your silence will be considered approval.”
* Each timeout is tracked in a Client Silent Approvals.csv
* Used for:
    - Text confirmations
    - Bug handling
    - Flow sign-offs

**Benefits:**

* Keeps project moving
* Transparent and documented
* Avoids fake misunderstandings later

**Related Process IDs:** N/A  

**Context & Problem:**
Sometimes, a mapper cannot complete their assigned area due to technical issues, restricted access, or time constraints—but there's no structured way to report or reassign it.  

**Goal:**
Log all incomplete mapping sessions and immediately plan recovery.  

**How It Works:**

* Each session log includes a field: Session Interrupted?
* If checked:
    - Provide reason: ❌ Technical issue, 🔐 Access denied, ⏰ Time expired
    - List incomplete areas
* The PM:
    - Reassigns the task to another mapper
    - Creates a recovery entry in the task tracker
* Logged in: Mission Outcome Log (Notion)

**Benefits:**

* Clear visibility on unfinished work
* Fast reassignment
* Zero area is forgotten

The CEO should lead, not manage operations. Teams must own their execution.

* Within 15 minutes of a CEO directive:
    - ✅ Create task in ClickUp or Slack
    - 🧠 Clear title
    - 👤 Assigned owner (not the CEO)
    - 📅 Execution date
    - 📝 Summary in task comments
* CEO only receives confirmation via Slack: "✅ Task created"
